<h2><a name="I" id="I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="h2a">GENERAL IGNORANCE</p>

<p class="indent">THERE was something pathetic in the
serene unconsciousness of the little
village as the stage came lumbering down
the hillside, bearing its freight of portent.
So many things were going to be changed
forever after,&mdash;and no one knew it. Such
a vast difference was going speedily to make
itself felt, and not a soul was aware even
of what a bigger soul it was so soon to be.
Old Mrs. Croft, clear at the other end of
town and paralyzed for twenty years,
hadn't the slightest conception of what a
leading part was being prepared for her
to play. Poor Katie Croft, her daughter-in-law
and slave, whose one prayer was for
freedom, dreamed not that the answer was
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;2]</span>
now at last coming near. Mrs. Cowmull,
sitting on her porch awaiting the &quot;artist
who had advertised,&quot; knew not who or
what or how old he might be or the interest
that would soon be hers. Poor Emily
Mead, shelling peas on the bench at the
back of her mother's house, frowned fretfully
and, putting back her great lock of
rich chestnut hair with an impatient gesture,
wished that she might see &quot;just one real
man before she died,&quot;&mdash;and the man was
even then jolting towards her. Miss Debby
Vane, putting last touches to the flowers
on her guest-room table, where Madeleine
would soon see them, was also sweetly
unaware of the approach of momentous
events. She thought but of Madeleine,
the distant cousin whose parents wanted
to see if absence would break up an obnoxious
love affair, and so were sending her
to Miss Debby, who was &quot;only too pleased.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A love affair,&quot; she whispered rapturously.
&quot;A <i>real</i> love affair in this town!&quot;
And then she pursed her lips delightfully,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;3]</span>
never guessing that she was to see so much
besides.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Miss Matilda Drew stood
looking sternly out of her sister Susan's
window, considering if there were any
necessary yet up to now forgotten point
to be impressed upon Jane the instant
that she should arrive. Miss Matilda was
naturally as ignorant as all the rest,&mdash;as
ignorant even as poor Susan, lying primly
straight behind her on the bed. Susan
was a widow and an invalid, not paralyzed
like old Mrs. Croft, but pretty helpless.
Matilda had lived with her for five years
and tended her assiduously, as she grew
more and more feeble. Now Matilda was
&quot;about give out,&quot; and&mdash;&quot;just like a
answer out of a clear sky,&quot; as Matilda said&mdash;their
niece Jane, whom neither had seen
since she was a mite in curls fifteen years
ago, had written to ask if she might spend
her holiday with them. They had said
&quot;Yes,&quot; and Matilda was going away for a
rest while Jane kept house and waited on
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;4]</span>
her poor old aunt. Jane was one of the
passengers now rattling along in the stage.
She differed widely from the others and
from every one else in the village, but all
put together, they formed that mass known
to literature as &quot;the situation.&quot; I think
myself that it was the rest that formed
&quot;the situation&quot; and that Jane formed
&quot;the key,&quot; but I may be prejudiced.
Anyway, &quot;key&quot; or not, Miss Matilda's
niece was a sweet, brown-skinned, bright-haired
girl, with a happy face, great,
beautiful eyes, and a heart that beat every
second in truer accord with the great
working principles of the universe. She
was the only one among them now who had
a foot upon the step that led to the path
&quot;higher up.&quot; And yet because she was
the only one, she had seen her way to come
gladly and teach them what they had never
known; not only that, but also to learn
of them the greatest lesson of her own life.
So we see that although conscious of both
hands overflowing with gifts, Jane really
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;5]</span>
was as ignorant, in God's eyes, as all the
rest. She had gone far enough beyond
the majority to know that to give is the
divinest joy which one may know, but she
had not gone far enough to realize that in
the greatest outpouring of generosity which
we can ever give vent to, a vacuum is
created which receives back from those we
benefit gifts way beyond the value of our
own. &quot;I shall bring so much happiness
here,&quot; ran the undercurrent of her thought;
she never imagined that Fate had brought
her to this simple village to fashion herself
unto better things.</p>

<p class="indent">So all, alike unaware&mdash;those in the
stage and those awaiting its advent with
passengers and post&mdash;drew long, relieved
breaths as it passed with rattle and clatter
over the bridge and into the main street.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;6]</span></p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="h2a">EVERYBODY GETS THERE</p>

<p class="indent">JANE sat on the rear seat with old Mr.
Cattermole, who was coming home
to his daughter, Mrs. Mead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ever been here before?&quot; old Mr. Cattermole
asked her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, never.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hey?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, never.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Once?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll tell you what it is,&quot; said Mr. Cattermole,
beaming benevolently, &quot;it's the
jolting. It keeps me from hearing what
you say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane nodded, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;7]</span>But old Mr. Cattermole wasn't long
inconvenienced by the jolting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who you going to stop with?&quot; he asked
next.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Ralston and Miss Drew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Ralston and Miss Drew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who? I don't hear you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Drew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Crews?&mdash;There ain't no such
people in town.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Drew!&quot; Jane became slightly
crimson.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll tell you,&quot; said Mr. Cattermole,
&quot;we'll wait. I can't hear. Really I can't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The next minute they arrived at Mrs.
Cowmull's, since she lived in the first
house on the street. Lorenzo Rath, the
artist, who had been sitting on the middle
seat with Madeleine, now pressed her
hand, twisted about and shook Jane's,
nodded to old Mr. Cattermole, leaned
forward and dragged his suit-case from
under the seat, and then wriggled out, over
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;8]</span>
two boxes and under a flapping curtain,
and down on to the sidewalk. Mrs. Cowmull
was standing on the porch, trying to
look hospitable and unconscious at the
same time. &quot;Here,&quot; said the stage driver,
suddenly delivering Lorenzo's trunk on to
the top of his head,&mdash;&quot;and here's the
lampshade and the codfish,&mdash;they get
down here, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo couldn't help laughing. &quot;Au
revoir,&quot; he cried, waving the lampshade
as the steps began to move.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We'll meet again soon,&quot; Madeleine
cried, her face full of bright color.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, of course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then they were off.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Seemed a nice young feller,&quot; said old
Mr. Cattermole to Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot; She tried to speak loudly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hey!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll tell you,&quot; said old Mr. Cattermole
benevolently, &quot;you come and see my granddaughter
Emily, and then we'll talk. My
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;9]</span>
granddaughter's a great student. You'll
like her. She's full of the new ideas and
new books and all that. We're very proud
of her. Only she don't get married.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the stage stopped, and Mrs. Mead
came running out. &quot;Oh, Father, did you
buy the new magazines,&mdash;on the train,
you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Old Mr. Cattermole was descending backwards
with the care of a cat in an apple-tree.
&quot;It's my daughter,&quot; he said to
Jane. &quot;I can always hear her because
she speaks so plain. Yes, Emma, it <i>was</i>
dusty, very dusty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This lawn-sprinkler is your's, ain't it?&quot;
said the stage driver, jerking it off the roof
into Mrs. Mead's arms. &quot;Here's his bag,
too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And then they went on again. Madeleine
now had space to turn about. &quot;You'll
come and see me?&quot; she asked Jane earnestly;
&quot;it'll be so nice. We're both
strangers here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll try,&quot; Jane answered, &quot;but I shall
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;10]</span>
be closely tied to the house. Aunt Susan
is an invalid, you see. I'll not only have
all the work, but if I go out, that poor
sick woman will be left helpless and alone
up-stairs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps I can come and see you, then,&quot;
said Madeleine. &quot;I'll have the time to
come, if you'll have the time to see me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know anything about what my
life will be,&quot; said Jane. &quot;As I told you
on the train, I've only seen my aunts once
in my life and that was fifteen years ago.
But I should think that you could come
and see us. I should think that a little
company would do Aunt Susan a lot of
good. I'm sure that it would, in fact.
But she may not like to see strangers. I
really don't know a thing about it. I'm
all in the dark.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll come and ask if I may come,&quot; said
Madeleine brightly. &quot;If she sees me,
maybe she'll like me. Most everybody
does.&quot; She laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm sure of that,&quot; Jane said, laughing,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;11]</span>
too. Then the stage stopped at Miss
Debby Vane's, and Miss Debby came
flying down to embrace her cousin.
&quot;Thanks be to God that you're here safe,
my dear. These awful storms at sea have
just about frightened me to death.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I was on land, Aunt Deborah.&quot;
Madeleine, in getting down, had gotten
into a warm embrace at the same time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know, dear, I know. But one can't
remember that all the time&mdash;can one?&quot;
Miss Debby was kissing her over and over.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your step-ladder. Look out!&quot; cried
the stage driver, and they had barely time
to jump from under.</p>

<p class="indent">Then Madeleine reached up and clasped
Jane's hand. &quot;We shall be friends,&quot; she
said earnestly; &quot;I've never met any one
whom I've liked quite in the same way
that I like you. Do let us see all that we
can of one another.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>I</i> want to, I know,&quot; Jane answered.</p>

<p class="indent">The stage driver was already remounting
his seat.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;12]</span>
&quot;Au revoir,&quot; Madeleine cried, just as
Lorenzo had done.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just for a little,&quot; Jane called back,
and then she was alone in the stage, rattling
down the long, green-arched street
to its furthest end.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There goes the stage,&quot; Katie Croft
called out to her mother-in-law in the
next room. &quot;Now Miss Drew'll have her
niece and be able to get away for a little
rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If it was a daughter-in-law, she couldn't,
maybe,&quot; said a voice from the next room;
&quot;the rest is going to be poor, sweet Susan
Ralston's, anyhow. Oh, my Susan Ralston,
my dear, sweet Susan Ralston, my
loving Susan Ralston, where I used to go
and call!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Mother, you haven't so much as
thought of Mrs. Ralston for years.&quot; Katie's
voice was very sharp.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nobody knows what I think of,&quot; wailed
the voice from the other room. &quot;My
thoughts is music. They fly and sing all
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;13]</span>
night. They sing Caw, Caw, and they
fly like feathers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katie Croft walked over and shut the
door with a bang. Katie was almost
beside herself.</p>

<p class="indent">The stage now drew up before the Ralston
house.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Matilda quitted the window, where
she had stood watching for an hour, and
went to the gate. Her emotions were
quite tumultuous&mdash;for her. Single-handed
she had tended her sister for five years,
and now she was going to have a rest.
She had had very trying symptoms, and
the doctor had advised a rest,&mdash;three
weeks of freedom, night and day. She was
going away on a real holiday, going back
to the place where she had taught school
before the summons had come to cherish,
love, and protect her only sister, who was
not strong and had property. It seemed
like a dream,&mdash;a wild, lively, and joyful
dream. She almost smiled as she thought
of what was at hand.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;14]</span>
Jane descended, her small trunk came
bang down beside her in the same instant,
and the driver was paid and drove off.
The aunt and niece then turned to go into
the house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, and so it's you!&quot; Matilda's
tone and glance were slightly inquisitorial,
and more than slightly dictatorial. &quot;I'm
glad to see you're strong. You'll need be.
She's an awful care. She ain't up much
now. Isn't up at all sometimes for weeks.
Sleeps considerable. Take off your hat
and coat and hang them there. That's
the place where they belong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane obeyed without saying anything.
But her smile spoke for her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hungry?&quot; inquired Matilda.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A little.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I surmised you would be and waited
supper. Thought you'd see how I fixed
hers then. She's eating very little. Less
and less all the time. There's a garden to
weed, too. Awful inconvenient out there
across two stiles. But she won't give it
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;15]</span>
up. She pays me to tend it, or I'd let the
dandelions root it out in short order. But
I tend it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They had gone into the kitchen, where
a kettle stewed feebly over a half-dead
fire. &quot;Sit down,&quot; said Matilda. &quot;I'll fix
her supper first. She takes her tea cold,
so I save it from morning and heat it up
with a little boiling water, <i>so</i>. Then there's
this bit of fish I saved from day before
yesterday, and I cut a piece of bread. No
butter, because her stomach's delicate.
You'll see that she'll hardly eat this.
Watch now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane sat and watched, still smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Rath, the artist, came down in the
stage with you, didn't he?&quot; Miss Matilda
went on. &quot;What kind of a young man
was he? Somebody'll tell you, so it might
as well be me, what's brought him here.
Mrs. Cowmull's trying to marry off her
niece, Emily Mead. There aren't any men
in town, so she advertised. She gave it out
that she wanted a boarder, but everybody
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;16]</span>
see through that. That's what marriage
has come to these days, catching men to
board 'em and then marrying them when
they're thinking of something else. I thank
Heaven I ain't had nothing to do with any
marriage. They're a bad business. There,
that's your supper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane started slightly. Her own cold
fish and lukewarm tea sat before her.
&quot;Shan't I take Aunt Susan's up first?&quot;
she asked, recollecting that she still had
some lunch in her bag, and that Matilda
would be leaving early in the morning.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No need. She likes things cold. You
ought to see her face if she gets anything
boiling in her mouth. It's no use to give
her nothing hot. You'd think it was a
snake. I give it up the third time she
burnt her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I ought to go up and see her, I
think; she hasn't seen me since I was such
a little girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No need. You go ahead and enjoy
your supper without bothering over her.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;17]</span>
She knows you're here, and she isn't one
that's interested in things. She'll read
an old shelf paper for hours, but carry
her up a new paper and like as not when
you get to the bed with it, you'll find her
asleep. She sleeps a lot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane&mdash;thus urged&mdash;picked the chilled
fish with a fork and considered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll show you about the house after
you've done eating,&quot; the aunt continued
presently; &quot;it's easy taken care of, for I
keep it all shut up. Just Susan's room
and mine and the kitchen is open. The
neighbors won't bother you, for I give them
to understand long ago as I wasn't one with
time to waste. There isn't any one in the
place that a woman with any sense would
want to bother with, anyhow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't fancy that I'll have time to be
lonesome,&quot; smiled Jane, bravely swallowing
some tea.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You'd have if it wasn't for the garden.
I don't know whatever in the world makes
Susan set such store by that garden. She
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;18]</span>
will have it that it shall be kept up in memory
of her husband, and you never saw such
weeds. I've often sat down backwards
when one come up&mdash;often.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't see it at all,&quot; with a glance out
of the window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can't from here. And it's got to be
watered, and she counts every pot full of
water from her bed. She can hear me pumping.
The birds dig up the seeds as fast as I
can plant 'em, and I never saw no sense in
slaving in the sun over what you can buy
in the shade any day.&mdash;Are you done?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I'm done.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then come on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can I spread the tray?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tray! She doesn't have a tray. What
should I fuss with a tray for, when I've
got two hands?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane rose and stood by the table in silence,
watching the cup filled from the standing
teapot and the plate ornamented with a
lonely bit of fish and a slice of bread.
&quot;Don't you butter the bread?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;19]</span>
&quot;She's in bed so much she mustn't
have rich food,&quot; Matilda answered; &quot;there,
now it's ready. Come on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shan't I carry anything?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can take it, I guess. I've carried it
alone for five years; I guess I can manage
it to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane followed up the stairs in silence;
Matilda marched ahead with a firm, heavy
tread.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shall I knock for you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know what for. She yells
anyway, whenever I come in, whether she's
knocked or not. Just open the door.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane opened the door gently, and they
went in together. The room was half
darkened, and only a little sharp nose
showed over the top of the bedquilt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here's your supper,&quot; said the affectionate
sister, &quot;and here's Jane.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A shrill cry was followed by two eyes
tipping upward beyond the nose. &quot;Oh,
are you Jane?&quot; There was a lot of pathos
in the tone.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;20]</span>
The girl moved quickly to the bedside.
&quot;I hope that we're going to be very happy,&quot;
she said; &quot;we must love one another very
much, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The invalid hoisted herself on to an elbow
and looked towards the plate which Matilda
was holding forth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my! Fish again!&quot; she wailed.</p>

<p class="indent">Later&mdash;on their way back to the kitchen
fire&mdash;Matilda said significantly: &quot;Most
ungrateful person I ever saw, she is. But
just don't notice what she says. It's the
only way to get on. I keep her room tidy
and I keep her house clean and I keep
her garden weeded. I'm careful of her
money, and she's well fed. I don't know
what more any one could ask, but she
ain't satisfied and she ain't always polite,
but you'll only have three weeks of what
I've had for five years, so I guess it won't
kill you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I think that I'll be all right,&quot; Jane
answered cheerfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The stage is ordered for seven in the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;21]</span>
morning, and I shall get up at half-past
four,&quot; the aunt continued. &quot;You can
sleep till five just as well. I'm going to
bed now, and you'd better do the same
thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I think so,&quot; said Jane cheerfully;
&quot;good night.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;22]</span></p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="h2a">MATILDA TEACHES</p>

<p class="indent">MATILDA seated herself bolt upright
on one of the kitchen chairs and
drew a hard, stiff sigh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It'll be a great rest to get away,&quot; she
said, &quot;more of a rest than any one but me
will ever know. You see, she's left all
she's got to me in her will, so I'm bound in
honor to keep a pretty sharp watch over
everything. I can't even take a chance
at her sinking suddenly away, with the
room not picked up or a cobweb in some
high corner. I've seen her will, and she
ain't left you a cent, so you won't have the
same responsibility. It'll be easier for
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll do my very best,&quot; said Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The trouble is I'm too conscientious,&quot;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;23]</span>
said Matilda. &quot;I was always conscientious,
and she was always slack. It's an
awful failing. It's a warning, too, for now
there she lays, snug as a bug in a rug, and
me with New Asthma in my arm from tending
her and the house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You'll get over all that very soon,&quot; said
the niece soothingly.</p>

<p class="indent">Matilda glanced at her suspiciously.
&quot;No, I shan't. I may get better, but I
shan't get over it. It's a nerve trouble
and can't never be completely cured. A
doctor can alligator it, but he can't cure
it. I'll have it till I die.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane was silent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You wrote that you were some kind of
a nurse. What kind did you say you
were?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm a Sunshine Nurse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A Sunshine Nurse! What's that?
Some new idea of never pulling down the
shades?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane laughed. &quot;Not exactly. It's an
Order just founded by a doctor. He picked
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;24]</span>
out the girls himself, and he sends them
where he chooses for training.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's the training?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane looked at her and hesitated a little.
&quot;I expect you'll laugh,&quot; she said finally;
&quot;it does sound funny to any one who isn't
used to such ideas. We're to see the sun
as always shining, and always shine ourselves,
and our training consists in going
where there isn't any brightness and being
bright, and going where there isn't any
happiness and teaching happiness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sounds to me like nonsense,&quot; said
Matilda, rising abruptly; &quot;don't you go
letting up the sitting-room shades and
fading the upholstering,&mdash;that's all I've
got to say. Come now and I'll show you
about locking up, and then we'll go to
bed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane obeyed with promptness and was
most observant and attentive. Matilda
loaded her with behests and instructions
and seemed appreciative of the intelligence
with which they were received.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;25]</span>
&quot;I wouldn't go in for nothing fancy,&quot;
she said, as they completed their task;
&quot;the less you stir up her and the house, the
easier it'll be for me when I come back.
You don't want to ever forget that I'm
coming back, and don't put any fancy ideas
into her head. There's plenty to do here
without going out of your way to upset
my ways.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll remember,&quot; said Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">Then they started up-stairs, and a few
minutes later the Sunshine Nurse was
alone in her own room, free to stand quietly
by the window and let her outward gaze
form a bond between the still beauty of
a country night and the glad vision of
work in plenty, and that of a kind which
Miss Matilda couldn't prohibit, because
she knew not the world in which such work
is done.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not&mdash;&quot; said Jane to herself with a
little whimsical smile&mdash;&quot;not but what
I'm 'most sure that my teaching will be
manifest in a lot of material changes, too,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;26]</span>
but by the time that she comes back, her
own feelings will be sufficiently 'alligatored'
so that she'll see life differently
also. God's plan is just as much for her
good in sending her away as it is for mine
in sending me here, and I mustn't forget
that for a minute. I'll be busy and she'll
be busy, and we'll both be learning and
we'll both be teaching and we'll both be
being necessary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She drew a chair close and sat down, full
of her own bright and helpful thoughts.
Much of love and wonder came flooding
into her through the medium of the sweet,
calm night without. &quot;It's like being among
angels,&quot; she fancied, and felt a close companionship
with those who had known the
Great White Messengers face to face.</p>

<p class="indent">Long she sat there, praying the prayer
that is just one indrawn breath of content
and uplifted consciousness. Not many girls
of twenty-two would have seen so much
in that not unusual situation, and yet it
was to her so brimful of fair possibilities
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;27]</span>
that she could hardly wait for morning to
begin work.</p>

<p class="indent">When she rose to undress, when she
climbed into the plain, hard bed that received
her so kindly, when she slept at
last, all was with the same sense of responsibility
mixed with energetic intention. All
that she had &quot;asked&quot; in the usual sense of
&quot;asking in prayer&quot; had been &quot;to be
shown exactly how,&quot; and because she was
one of those who know every prayer to be
answered, in the hour of its making she
knew that to be answered, too. &quot;I'll be
led along,&quot; was her last thought before
sleeping, and it swept the fringe of her consciousness,
leaving her to enter dreamland
with the happy security of a trusting child.</p>

<p class="indent">It really seemed no time at all before
Matilda rapped loudly on her door, bringing
her suddenly to the knowledge that
the hour to begin all the longed-for work
was at hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Five o'clock!&quot; Matilda howled gently
through the crack.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;28]</span>
&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; she cried in response.</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened a bit wider. &quot;You'd
better get right up or you'll go to sleep
again,&quot; Matilda said, putting her head in,
&quot;right this minute.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She sat up in bed to prove it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right,&quot; said her aunt&mdash;and shut
the door.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane had unpacked her small trunk the
night before, and so was able to dress
quickly and get down-stairs without a
minute wasted. She found Matilda in
the kitchen, very busy with the stove.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do hope you'll remember what I said
last night,&quot; she said, shoveling out ashes
with an energy that filled the room with
dust. &quot;I can't have her habits all upset.
It'll be no good giving me this change if
you go and spoil her. Remember that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I won't make any trouble,&quot; promised
Jane. &quot;I'll always remember that you're
coming back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As she spoke, she saw again the thin,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;29]</span>
hopeless face on the pillow up-stairs and
knew that Matilda herself was to know a
glad surprise over the change which should
welcome her home-coming. It was the
learning to instantly realize the better
side of those who insisted on exhibiting
their worst that was the leading force in
the training of that beaming little Order
to which she belonged. The Sunshine
Nurses were forbidden to consider anything
or anybody as fixedly wrong either in kind,
conception, or working out. It would be
a very comfortable way of looking at things&mdash;even
for such mere, ordinary, everyday
folk as you and me.</p>

<p class="indent">Matilda now said, &quot;Ugh, ugh!&quot; over
the dust and proceeded to dive into the
wood-box with one hand and get a sliver
in her thumb.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the morning she has tea,&quot; she said,
going to the window to put her hand to
rights. &quot;One cup. Piece of bread. At
noon, whatever is handy. Night, cup of
tea and whatever she fancies. Bread or a
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;30]</span>
cracker usually. She eats very little and
less all the time. The cat eats more than
she does. He's a snooper, that cat,&mdash;you'll
have to watch out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane didn't seem to understand. &quot;A&mdash;a
snooper?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Steals food. Awful thief. Slap him
when you catch him at it; it's all you can
do. Sometimes I throw water over him.
He'll make off with what would be a meal
for a hired man, and he's sly as any other
thief.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can't I help you with your hand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, you can't. I get lots of them.
They bother me a little because Mrs.
Croft's cousin died of blood-poison from
one. There, it's out. What was I saying?
Oh, yes, the cat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is she now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's a he. Named Alfred for her husband.
He's up in her room now. Always
sleeps on her bed. She will have him, and
I humor her. She's my only sister and
she can't live long and she's left me all her
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;31]</span>
money, and I humor her. It's my plain
duty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it healthy for an invalid to sleep with
a cat?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, it ain't. But I promised to do
whatever she said about the cat and the
garden, and I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm sure it's very good in you,&quot; Jane
murmured, looking out of the window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is. I'm a good woman. I do my
whole duty, and there's not many in a town
this size can say as much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is the garden?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll show you, if you don't mind getting
your feet wet. I have my rubbers on
already, to travel, so I can go right there
now while the fire is kindling.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it wet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Most grass is wet, at five in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane wanted to laugh. &quot;I mean, isn't
there a path?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Part way, and then you have to climb
two fences.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;32]</span>
&quot;Climb! Two!&quot; the niece turned in
surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Climb two fences. You never saw
such a place. The strip between is rented
for a cow-pasture. That's why there's
two fences.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why not have gates?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't ask me. Find out if you can.
I've lived here five years, and I ain't found
out. You try and see if you'll do better.
She's very secretive, and so was he before
he died. I've just had to get along the
best I could. She fails and fails steady,
but it don't seem to affect her health none,
and now at last it's affected mine instead
and give me neophytes in my left arm.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane turned her head and looked some
more out of the window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We'll go now. Might as well. The
kettle will get to boiling while we're away,
and then we'll have breakfast. It boils
slow, because I've got the eggs in it for
my lunch. Come on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The question of the wet grass seemed to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;33]</span>
have faded. They went out the kitchen
door. It was a clear, bright morning.
&quot;Weedy weather,&quot; commented Matilda,
and led the way down the path.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's a pretty place,&quot; said Jane, her eyes
roaming happily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I suppose so. But it takes an
artist or some one who hasn't lived in it
for five years to feel that way.&quot; She
paused to climb the first fence. It was
three rails high and very awkward. &quot;I'll
go over first,&quot; she said. &quot;Think of it;
I've done this six times a day for five
years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane didn't wonder that she was so agile
at it. &quot;But how funny to have a garden
away off here!&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Matilda was now over on the other side.
&quot;Yes, and think of keeping it up. Folks
about here make no bones of telling me
that they were both half-witted, only as
she's my sister, they try to give me to
understand as she caught it from him.
He was a miser, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;34]</span>
Jane was just getting her second leg
over. &quot;I don't know a thing about him,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you will, soon enough. The
neighbors'll come flocking as soon as I'm
gone, and you'll soon know all there is to
know about us all. They'll pick me to
pieces, too, and tell you I'm starving Susan
to death, but I don't care. Climbing these
fences has hardened me to calumny.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They crossed the strip of cow-pasture,
and Matilda got over another fence, saying
as she did so: &quot;Whom the Lord loveth
He chasteneth,&quot; leaving Jane to make
the application and follow her at the same
time.</p>

<p class="indent">Then they found themselves in a trim
little garden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How sweet,&quot; said the niece.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can see I've done my duty by it,
too,&quot; said Matilda; &quot;that's my way.
I'm hard and I ain't pretty to look at, but
I do my duty, which is more'n most handsome
women do. Every last bean here is
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;35]</span>
clawed around like it ought to be, and the
whole thing neat as wax. Same with
Susan; you'd think from her face I'd
murdered her, and yet the Recording Angel
knows she's had a cold sponge and every
last snarl combed out of her hair every
day since I came. I don't boast, but I do
work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me, it's a long way from the
house,&quot; said Jane, forgetting her higher
philosophy for the minute.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's a good ten minutes to get here.
A picking of peas is a half-hour's job. And
ten to one, when I get back, the cat's been
at the cream.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane had had time to remember. &quot;I
can see you've been awfully good,&quot; she
said warmly, &quot;and my, but you've worked
hard. Everything shows that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Matilda's face flushed with pleasure,
the sudden pathetic flushing of unexpected
appreciation. &quot;I just have,&quot; she declared.
&quot;I've worked hard all my life and done a
lot of good, and nobody's ever bothered
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;36]</span>
to thank me. She don't. She just lays
there and lets me run up and down stairs
and climb fences and dig weeds and scamper
back and forth with a extra hike, when I
hear the bell of the door, till it'll be a mercy
if I don't get neophytes all over, and the
New Asthma in both legs, <i>I</i> think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After a brief tour of the tiny whole,
devoted mainly to instructing the novice,
Matilda led the way back to the house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Does it ever need watering?&quot; Jane
asked, lapsing again to a lower level.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sometimes,&quot; said Matilda briefly. Jane
hadn't the heart to say another word until&mdash;several
steps further on&mdash;it occurred
to her that the garden also could be only
a good factor in God's plan, if she wreathed
it and shrined it and saw it in her world,
as He saw all His world on the day when it
was first manifest and set. &quot;And God
saw everything that He had made, and
behold, it was very good.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="h2a">JANE BEGINS SUNSHINING</p>

<p class="indent">THE stage came for Matilda at eight
o'clock. For half an hour before it
could possibly be due, the traveler sat
ready on a chair in the hall, with her umbrella
tightly gripped in both hands, delivering
bits of useful information as they
occurred to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Be careful to lock up well every night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Remember if she dies sudden, I shall
want to know at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't look to enjoy yourself, but remember
you're doin' a act of Christian
charity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane sat on a small, hard ottoman in
the corner by the whatnot and said: &quot;I'll
try,&quot; or &quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; every time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're a good girl,&quot; the aunt said
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;38]</span>
finally. &quot;I'm glad to know you. Those
Rainy-day Cooks or whatever you call
yourself&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sunshine Nurse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, of course,&mdash;well, it's a good idea.
I feel perfectly sure you'll do everything
you know how.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I will,&quot; said Jane, resolving all
over fresh that everything was going to
come out fine, even to the return of Matilda
herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, I hear the stage on the bridge,&quot;
said her aunt, jumping to her feet suddenly.
&quot;I must go and say good-by to Susan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn't she still asleep?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn't matter. She's my only living
sister, and it's my duty to wake her up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She rushed up-stairs, and a feeble little
yell from above soon announced her duty
done. Then followed a brief hum and
jabber, and then she came running down
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Feels bad to see me go,&quot; she said briefly.
&quot;That's natural, as she's turned over to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;39]</span>
you body and soul and ain't the least idea
what you're like. I told her it was no more
chances than every child run just being
born, and a third of them lived, but she
never could see reason,&mdash;kind of clung
to my arm,&mdash;she's my only sister, and it
makes me feel bad.&quot; With which hasty
statement Matilda gave a brief dab to
each eye, put up her pocket-handkerchief,
and opened the front door. Jane had her
bag in her hand, and they had carried the
trunk to the gate before.</p>

<p class="indent">The stage was empty, and the driver was
tying the trunk-strap with a rope.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, good-by,&quot; said Matilda; &quot;remember
to lock up well every night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I will,&quot; said Jane. &quot;I hope you'll
have a good time and a splendid change.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm sure of the change,&quot; said Matilda,
swinging herself up with an agility bred of
her liberal diet on stiles. &quot;Five years,&mdash;will
you only think of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The driver picked up the reins, gave them
a slap, and the expedition was off.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;40]</span>
Matilda Drew was really &quot;gone off on a
visit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Think of it,&quot; said Katie Croft, who,
despite her town-name of &quot;Katie,&quot; was a
gray-haired woman of fifty. &quot;Think of
it! A vacation! What luck some folks
have. I shall never have a vacation in
all&mdash;&quot; her voice ceased, and she continued
sweeping down the steps, the stage passing
out of sight as she did so.</p>

<p class="indent">Meanwhile Jane had re-entered the house
and carefully closed the door after her.
She felt curiously freed in spirit, and that
subtly supreme joy of seeing a helplessly
bad situation delivered bound and gagged
into one's hands to be mended was hers.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll go straight and ask about auntie's
breakfast first,&quot; she thought, mounting
the staircase. To her light tap at the
door, a feeble &quot;come in&quot; responded. She
entered then and observed, with a slight
start, that the invalid had just been up.
The blind was drawn, and a pair of kicked-off
slippers betrayed a hasty jump back
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;41]</span>
into bed. Her eyes sought Susan's in
explanation. &quot;I didn't know that you
could move about,&quot; she said, with a pleased
look.</p>

<p class="indent">Susan's little, sharp nose had an apologetic
appearance, as it showed over the
sheet-fold. &quot;I can get about a little, days
when I'm strong,&quot; she explained, &quot;and I
wanted to see her off. I wanted to see if
she really did go.&quot; She paused, gave a
sharp choke and gasp, and then waited.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane leaned over and kissed her forehead.
&quot;I will try very hard to make you comfortable
and happy,&quot; she said gently.</p>

<p class="indent">Susan rather shrunk together in the bed.
&quot;What kind of a girl are you, anyhow?&quot;
she asked suddenly and sharply. &quot;Are
you really religious, or do you only just go
to church?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I try to do what's right,&quot; her niece
answered simply.</p>

<p class="indent">The invalid contemplated her intently.
&quot;It can be pretty hard living with any
one that tries to do right,&quot; she said. &quot;My
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;42]</span>
experience is that good people is often
more trying than bad ones. Maybe it's
just that I've had more to do with them,
though. I suppose Matilda told you about
everything and the garden and all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I think I know what to see to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And the cat?&mdash;and his stealing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, she told me about him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The garden must be weeded,&quot; Susan
pronounced, sinking down deep into the
bed. &quot;Don't you ever forget that. And
that cat has got to be fed&mdash;and well fed,
too&mdash;even if he does steal.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane watched her disappear beneath the
bedclothes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Auntie,&quot; she said, &quot;I've got lots of
funny ideas, and one of them is that it's
wicked not to be just as happy as possible
every minute. Now I'm to be here three
weeks, and I think that I ought to be able
to make them a real change for you as well
as for Aunt Matilda. We'll begin with
your breakfast. You tell me what you
like best, and I'll fix it for you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;43]</span>
Susan's head came up out of the bed-clothes
with the suddenness of a boy rising
from a dive. &quot;If I can have anything I
want,&quot; she cried, &quot;I want some hot tea&mdash;some
boiling hot tea, some tea made with
water that's boiling as hard as it can boil.
And I want the pot hot. Burning hot
before the tea goes in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane started. &quot;I thought you liked your
tea cold.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan's eyes fairly snapped. &quot;Well, I
don't. I don't like nothing cold. I like
everything hot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane moved towards the door. &quot;I'll
go and make some right away,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Susan's small, bright eyes looked after
her very hard indeed. &quot;I wonder if you
really mean what you say about my doing
what I please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I mean what I say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I want to go back into my own
room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The niece stopped. &quot;Isn't this your
room?&quot; she asked in surprise.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;44]</span>
&quot;No, this is the nearest room to the top
of the stairs. I'll show you which is my
room.&quot; With a quick leap she was out
of bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Barefooted!&quot; cried Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll get into slippers quick enough, and
I always wear stockings in bed. It's one
of my peculiar ways. I'm very peculiar.&quot;
She was running out of the room. Jane
followed, astonished at the strength and
steadiness of the bedridden.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I thought that&mdash;that you were
always in bed,&quot; she stammered.</p>

<p class="indent">Susan stopped short and turned about.
&quot;It was the pleasantest way to get along,&quot;
she said briefly. &quot;I guess that you've a
really kind heart, so I'll trust you and tell
you the truth. Matilda wasn't here very
long before I see that if her patience wasn't
to give out, I'd got to begin to fail. I went
to bed, and I've failed ever since. I've
failed steady. It's been the only thing
to do. It wasn't easy, but it was that or
have things a lot harder. So I failed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;45]</span>
Jane stared in amazement, and then
suddenly the fun of it all overcame her,
and she burst out laughing. Susan laughed,
too. &quot;It was all I could do,&quot; she repeated
over and over.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And so you failed,&quot; said her niece, still
laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and so I failed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mercy on us, it's the funniest thing I
ever heard in all my life,&quot; exclaimed the
Sunshine Nurse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It ain't always been funny for me,&quot;
said Susan, &quot;but come, now, I want to
show you my room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She opened a door as she spoke and led
the way into a dark, musty-smelling place.
It was the work of only a minute to draw
the blind and throw up the window.
&quot;Right after we've had breakfast, we'll
clean it,&quot; the aunt declared, &quot;and then
I'll move right back in. Husband and me
had this room for twenty long years together.
He was a saving man, and most
of what he was intending to save when I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;46]</span>
wanted to buy things was told me in this
room. Whatever I wanted he always said
I could have, and then when it came night,
he said I couldn't. The room is full of
memories for me&mdash;sad memories&mdash;but
after he was mercifully snatched to everlasting
blessedness, I grew fond of it. It's
a nice room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I'll get your tea,&quot; said Jane,
&quot;and then I'll clean this room and help
you move into it. We'll have you all
settled before noon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She turned and ran down to the kitchen.
The kettle was singing, and she stuffed
more wood in under it and began to hunt
for a tray and the other concomitants of
an up-stairs breakfast. Things were not
easily found.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I declare!&quot; a voice at the window
behind her exclaimed, as she was down on
her knees getting a tray-cloth out of a
lower drawer. The voice gave her a violent
start, being a man's. She sprang to
her feet and faced about.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;47]</span>
&quot;I'm sorry; I thought you'd know me.&quot;
It was the artist of the day before, the
young man who had come down in the
stage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's so early.&quot; She went to the window
and shook hands. &quot;But I'm glad to see
you, anyhow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I always get up at six and walk five
miles before breakfast when I'm in the
country,&quot; he explained.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you really? What enterprise!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And so this is where you've come.
Why, it's the quaintest old place that I
ever saw. A regular tangle of picturesque
possibilities. Who are you visiting?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm taking care of my invalid aunt
while my other aunt has a little rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she very ill?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no. But this is her tea that I'm
making, and I must take it up to her now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll go, then. But may I come again&mdash;and
sketch?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't have company. I'll be too
busy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;48]</span>
&quot;Can't I help with the work?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He was so pleasant and jolly that she
couldn't help laughing. &quot;I'm afraid not,&quot;
she said, shaking her head.</p>

<p class="indent">He stood with his hand on the window-sash.
&quot;Do you know my name?&quot; he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's Lorenzo, Lorenzo Rath. I've to
grow famous with that name. Think of
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can draw the outside of the house,
anyhow&mdash;can't I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me, I suppose so,&quot;&mdash;she picked
up the tray,&mdash;&quot;you must go now, though.
Good-by.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-by,&quot; he cried after her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, see the steam,&quot; was Susan's exultant
exclamation, as she entered her room.
&quot;I ain't seen steam coming out of a teapot's
nose for upwards of three years.
Matilda just couldn't seem to stand my
taking my tea hot, and she's my only sister,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;49]</span>
and I humor her. Who was you talking
to?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A man who came down on the stage
yesterday. He was out walking and didn't
know that I lived here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, a love affair!&quot; cried Susan, in
high-keyed ecstasy. &quot;He's fallen in love
with you, and like enough was prowling
around all night. Oh! How interesting!
I ain't seen a love affair close to for
years.&quot; She was so genuinely joyful that
Jane felt sorry to dampen the enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't believe you'll see one now,&quot;
she said, smiling good-humoredly. &quot;You
see, I don't mean to marry, Auntie. I'm a
Sunshine Nurse, and they have their hands
too full for that kind of thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A nurse! I didn't know you were a
nurse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A Sunshine Nurse is a person who does
what doctors can't always do,&mdash;who makes
folk well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you going to make me well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jane, resolutely.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;50]</span>
Susan stopped eating and looked at her
with an expression full of contradictory
feelings. &quot;I shall like it,&quot; she said slowly.
&quot;But, oh my! Matilda won't. Why, she&mdash;&quot;
she paused. &quot;Oh, I <i>do</i> wonder if I
can trust you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anybody can trust me,&quot; said Jane.
&quot;It's part of my training to be honest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me, but that's a good idea,&quot;
said Susan, with sincerest approval. &quot;Well,
if I can trust you, I don't mind telling
you that it's taken considerable care for
me to live along with Matilda. I don't
mean anything against her&mdash;not rat-poison
nor anything like that, you know?&mdash;but
she hasn't just approved of my living; she's
looked upon it as a waste of her time.
And I've had to manage pretty careful
in consequence. You see, she's my only
sister, and she'd have my property anyhow,
but if I had to have a nurse or a woman to
look out for me long, there'd be no property
to leave. She's real sensible, and we
both know just how it is, but it's been
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;51]</span>
pleasantest for me to stay more and more
in bed and kind of catch at things as I walk,
and once in a while I don't eat all day, and
so it keeps up her hope and keeps things
pleasant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane looked paralyzed. &quot;How can you
go without food all day?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan considered a little. Then she
took a big drink of hot tea and confessed.
&quot;I don't really. I watch till she goes
to the garden, and then I skip down-stairs
and make a good meal and lay it all on
the cat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane sank down on the foot of the bed
and burst out laughing again. Again she
just couldn't help it. Susan laughed, too;
first softly and gingerly, then in a way
almost as hearty as her niece's.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh me, oh my,&quot; the latter declared,
after a minute, wiping her eyes. &quot;Well,
we'll have a very lively three weeks, I
see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Susan exclaimed, &quot;and we'll
have liver and bacon, and I'll see the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;52]</span>
neighbors when they come in. I give up
seeing them because it made so much
trouble, and the way I'm made is&mdash;'Anything
for peace.' That's what I always
used to say to husband, whatever he said.
First along I used to say real things, but
all the last years I just said whatever he
said; anything for peace.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You've finished your tea now,&quot; said
Jane, rising. &quot;I'll take the tray down while
you dress a bit, and then we'll move you
into the other room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, and <i>how</i> I will enjoy it,&quot; cried
Susan, clasping her hands in ecstasy. &quot;Oh,
you Sunshine Jane, you&mdash;how glad I am
you've come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm glad, too,&quot; said Jane. &quot;We'll have
an awfully nice time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She ran down-stairs with the tray and
found Madeleine sitting in the kitchen,
waiting. &quot;Why, how long have you been
here?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine lifted a rather mournful countenance
and tried to smile. &quot;Oh, Miss
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;53]</span>
Grey. I'm so blue. I can't stand this
place at all, I don't believe. My situation
is going to be unbearable.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What's the matter with it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's so small and petty and spiteful.
All last evening I had to sit and listen to
gossip. I hate personalities. Why, whatever
I do is going to be seen and talked
about the minute I do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane looked grave. &quot;That nice woman
who came out to meet you didn't look like
a gossip.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She isn't, but she sits and listens, and
every once in a while she throws oil on
the fire by saying, '<i>I</i> never believed the
story.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who did the talking?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The neighbors&mdash;a woman named Mrs.
Mead, who came in with her daughter.
The mother was old-fashioned in her ideas,
and the daughter was new. That old
man in the stage stopped there, you
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My aunt spoke of them last evening,&quot;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;54]</span>
said Jane; &quot;she said that Emily Mead
was picked out to marry that young man
who came down with us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine laughed and then blushed.
&quot;I'm afraid not,&quot; she said. &quot;I know him.
He won't marry anybody here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane turned and began to put away the
breakfast things.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't be bored,&quot; she said gently. &quot;Put
on this extra apron, and help me wash
these dishes; and then I'll set the kitchen
to rights and get ready to move my aunt
into another bedroom. She's an invalid,
you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What kind of a person is your aunt?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Awfully nice,&quot; began Jane, but was
stopped by the sudden opening of the hall
door.</p>

<p class="indent">There stood Susan, all dressed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems good to have clothes on again,&quot;
she remarked calmly; &quot;I ain't been dressed
for upwards of three years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then she saw Madeleine. &quot;How do
you do,&quot; she said, holding out her hand.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;55]</span>
&quot;I suppose you're the Miss Mar from
Deborah's?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Madeleine admitted, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My, but you look good to me,&quot; said
Susan; &quot;it's so nice to see a strange face.
You see, I've been in bed for a long time,
and I give up seeing strangers long before
that.&quot; She sat down on one of the
kitchen chairs and beamed on them both,
turn and turn about. &quot;Husband always
thought that strangers was pickpockets,&quot;
she said, &quot;but I like to look at 'em. My,
but I will enjoy these next weeks. You
see, I live with my sister,&quot; she explained to
Madeleine, &quot;and I've had a pretty hard
time. My sister's got a good heart, but
maybe you know how awful hard it is to
live with that kind of people. It's been
pleasanter to stay in bed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you won't do that any more,
Auntie,&quot; said Jane, moving busily about.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, indeed I won't. You see,&quot; again
to Madeleine, &quot;she was my only sister, so
I humored her. It's the only way to get
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;56]</span>
on with some people. But you can even
humor folks too much, and she got a disease
they call the Euphrates all up and down
her ear and her elbow, just from being
humored too much. So she's gone off for
a change.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Madeleine asked
Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Making waffles. I thought it would
be fun to eat them hot right now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan fairly shrieked with joy. &quot;I ain't
so much as smelt one since husband died.
Waffles in the morning, and I'm so awful
hungry, too. Oh, Jane, the Lord will
surely set a crown of glory on your head
the minute He sees it. Your feet won't
be into heaven when the crown goes on.
How did you ever think of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane brought out the iron, laughing as
she did so. &quot;Why, Auntie, it's part of
my training.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cooking waffles in the morning?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. Giving joy. If I think of any
way to give pleasure and don't do it, I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;57]</span>
count it a sin. To make more happiness is
all the work of a Sunshine Nurse.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn't that splendid?&quot; Susan appealed to
Madeleine.</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine's great, beautiful eyes were
lifted towards the other girl's face with an
expression mysterious in its longing.
&quot;Teach me the gift,&quot; she said; &quot;I want to
make more happiness, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We'll be her class,&quot; exclaimed Susan,
&quot;just you and me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The first lesson is eating waffles,&quot; Jane
announced solemnly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And me, too,&quot; cried a voice in the
kitchen window, and there was Lorenzo
Rath back for his second call that day, and
it not yet ten o'clock. &quot;I've been to Mrs.
Cowmull's and eaten breakfast, and I'm as
hungry as a wolf.&quot; He came in through
the window as he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, a young man!&quot; cried Susan. &quot;I
ain't seen a young man since the last time
the pump broke. Oh, my! Ain't this
jolly? Ain't this fun?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;58]</span>
&quot;You show Madeleine where to find
plates and forks and knives, Auntie,&quot;
said Jane. &quot;Here, Mr. Rath, I'll break
two more eggs and you can beat them. I
haven't made enough batter, if there's a
man to eat, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I feel as if I'd leave Mrs. Cowmull's
to-morrow and come here to board,&quot; said
Lorenzo. &quot;Could I?&quot; His tone was very
earnest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, you couldn't,&quot; said Jane firmly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, let him,&quot; exclaimed Susan, from the
pantry, where she was getting out plates.
&quot;It'll make Mrs. Cowmull so mad, and I
ain't made any one mad for years and years.
I'd so revel to be human again. And it
would be so nice having a man about, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn't think of it,&quot; said Jane, getting
very crimson.</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine looked at the artist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then I shall leave Mrs. Cowmull's,
anyway,&quot; said Lorenzo, decidedly; &quot;I shall
look up another place at once. Why, that
woman would drive me mad. She says
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;59]</span>
something ridiculous every time she opens
her mouth. She asked me this morning
if I'd ever climbed to the top of the
Kreutzer Sonata.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did you say?&quot; Madeleine asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told her no, but I'd been to the bottom
of the Campanile and seen them getting
out coal from the mine there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, that showed you'd seen some
sights, anyhow,&quot; said Susan, placidly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The waffles are done!&quot; Jane announced.
They all drew up round the table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is living,&quot; the invalid exclaimed.
&quot;If my sister would only never come back!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maybe she won't!&quot; suggested Lorenzo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wouldn't like her to die,&quot; said Susan,
gravely. &quot;I'm sensitive over feeling people
better off dead. But if she'd marry, it would
be nice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For the man?&quot; queried Lorenzo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For us all,&quot; said Susan, gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just exactly the right thing is going to
happen to her and everybody,&quot; said Jane,
firmly&mdash;dividing the waffles as she spoke.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;60]</span>
&quot;Are you so sure?&quot; the artist asked,
looking a little amused.</p>

<p class="indent">Susan noticed the look. &quot;She's a Sunshine
Nurse,&quot; she explained quickly. &quot;It's
her religion to be like that. She can't
help it. She's promised.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;61]</span></p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="h2a">A CHANGE IN THE FEEL OF THINGS</p>

<p class="indent">IT didn't take long for the town to wake up
to the fact that some new element had
entered into its composition.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't get over it, Susan Ralston's
being up and about,&quot; Miss Debby Vane
said distressedly to Mrs. Mead. &quot;Why,
she was 'most dead!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Matilda ought not to have gone away,&quot;
Mrs. Mead said sternly. &quot;Sick folks in
bed can't bear a change. A new face
gives them a little spurt of strength, and
then when they see the old face again, they
kind of give up hope and drop right off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know that,&quot; said Miss Debby;
&quot;my father had a cousin die that way.
There was a doctor going about in a wagon,
pulling teeth and giving shocks, and he said
he'd give Cousin Hannah a shock and cure
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;62]</span>
her. So they took him up-stairs, and there
she was dead of heart disease. They
thought of prosecuting him, but the funeral
coming right on they hadn't time, and
then he was gone to another place, and it
seemed too much bother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That girl is just the same kind, I believe,&quot;
said Mrs. Mead; &quot;that dreadful
way of making you feel that after all what
she says is pretty sensible, maybe. My
Emily is awfully took with her, and Father's
just crazy about her. He come down on
the stage with her, and then he went out to
see her. She knows how to get around men;
she was frying doughnuts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and Mrs. Cowmull's artist was
out there, and they had waffles in the middle
of the morning. That's a funny kind of
new religion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has she got a new religion?&quot; Miss
Debby looked frightened. &quot;I hadn't heard
of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, yes; Emily says she's got the
funniest religion you ever heard of. Whatever
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;63]</span>
she wants to do or don't want to do,
she says it's her religion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me, but I should think that that
would be very convenient,&quot; said Miss
Debby, much impressed. &quot;Why, my religion
is always just the opposite of what I
want to do or don't want to do. It says
so every Sunday, you know,&mdash;'we have
done those things,' and so forth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hers is different,&quot; said Mrs. Mead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I declare,&quot; repeated Miss Debby;
then, suddenly, &quot;I remember now that
Madeleine said that they had waffles because
Jane said that she thought waffles
would taste good, and it was her religion
to do whatever you thought of right off.
Well, I declare!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Both ladies stared in solemn amazement
at one another.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This'll be a nice town to live in, if she
sets everybody to doing whatever you like,
because it's right,&quot; Mrs. Mead said finally.
&quot;Father won't put on his coat again this
summer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;64]</span>
&quot;It'll make a great difference in the feeling
of the town,&quot; said Miss Debby, mysteriously,
&quot;a great difference. Well, I hope
it won't change Madeleine any way her
family won't approve. Madeleine's in love,
and I suppose it's Mr. Rath. They knew
each other before, and her family don't
want it. I've pieced it all out of scraps.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; said Emily Mead's mother,
her face falling; &quot;my, I hadn't heard but
what he was a free man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no,&quot; said Miss Debby, &quot;your sister
isn't sure. But everybody else is. My own
view of artists is they're deluders and snares.
I give an artist a picture and a dollar once
to enlarge, and that was the last I ever heard
of them both&mdash;of all three.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder if Emily knows Mr. Rath's
engaged,&quot; said Mrs. Mead, sadly. &quot;Dear me,
I never thought of that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not engaged, but in love,&quot; corrected
Miss Debby.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps he's a real artist and changeable,&quot;
suggested Mrs. Mead.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;65]</span>
&quot;There's no comfort in that for any one,
'cause if he'll change once, he'll change right
along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Mead sighed very heavily. &quot;Well,
I must keep up for Father and Emily,&quot;
she remarked, not tracing any very clear
connection between word and deed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Miss Debby, &quot;you must, and
we'll all keep a sharp eye on these new kind
of ways of looking at things, for we don't
know where they'll end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The &quot;new way of looking at things&quot; had
already been very efficacious in the house
at the other end of the street. It had
assumed an utterly new appearance, both
outside and in.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I never felt nothing like the change
in the <i>feel</i> of it,&quot; Susan exclaimed that
afternoon, as she re-arranged her belongings
in her own room. &quot;Oh, you Sunshine
Jane, you, you've just sunshone into every
room, and I'm so happy turning my things
about I don't know what to do. Matilda
wouldn't never let me turn a china cow
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;66]</span>
other end to, and I've lived with some of
the ornaments facing wrong for the whole
of these five long years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn't me, Auntie,&quot; said Jane, washing
shelves with the hearty and happy energy
which she threw into every task in which
she engaged; &quot;it's the opening of the windows
and the letting in of God and His
sunshine together. I'll soon have time to
clean the whole house, and then we'll
have fun re-arranging every room. You've
such pretty things, and they must be
rubbed up and given a chance to play a
part in the world. God never meant anything
to be idle,&mdash;not even a brass andiron.
If it can't work, it can shine and be cheerful,
anyway. What can't smile ought to shine,
you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder why rubbing things makes 'em
bright,&quot; said Susan, opening her bonnet-box
and hitting her bonnet a smart cuff to
knock dust out of the folds. &quot;I never could
understand that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's your individuality that you transfer
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;67]</span>
till the poor dull things get enough of it to
shine alone, without anybody's help.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a good reason,&quot; said Susan.
&quot;My, to think maybe I'll go to church
again in this bonnet! Matilda was always
wanting to rip it up, but something made
me cling to it. It's a kind of souvenir.
I wore it to husband's funeral and my last
picnic, and there are lots of other pleasant
memories inside it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll freshen it up with a cloth dipped in
ammonia,&quot; said Jane. &quot;Dear me, how I <i>do</i>
enjoy washing shelves. I love to sop the
soapy water over and mop the corners,
and dry the whole, and fit a clean newspaper
in, and then see the closet in perfect
order.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You like to do everything, seems to me,&quot;
said Susan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I do. I've been led to see that
doing things well is about the finest way
in which one can pass one's time. And I'm
crazy over doing things <i>well</i>. If I fold a
towel, I like to fold it just square, and if I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;68]</span>
make a bed, I want the fold in the spread
and the fold in the sheet to meet even.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You'll make a fine wife, Jane,&quot; said
Susan, gravely, &quot;only no man'll ever appreciate
the folds lying straight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane laughed merrily. &quot;I'm never going
to marry; I'm one of the new sex, the
creatures who are born to live alone and
lend a hand anywhere. Didn't you know
that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's nonsense,&quot; said Susan; &quot;no
woman's made so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No. It's a big fact. One of the newest
facts in the world. The New Woman, you
know!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mercy on us,&quot; said Susan, &quot;don't
you go in for any of that nonsense. The
idea of a girl like you deciding not to marry!
I never heard of such a thing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's so, though,&quot; said Jane, smiling
brightly; &quot;you see, my little Order is a kind
of Sisterhood. We're taught to want to
help in so many homes and to never even
think of a home of our own. We're taught
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;69]</span>
to love all children so dearly that we mustn't
limit ourselves to one family of little ones.
We're trained to be so fond of the best in
every man that we see more good to be done
as sisters to men than as wives.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't believe Mr. Rath will agree with
you,&quot; said Susan, &quot;nor any other real nice
fellow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane was cutting paper for the shelves.
&quot;Yes, he will,&quot; she said, nodding confidently;
&quot;men are so scarce nowadays
that they are ready to agree with any
one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jane, <i>I</i> think he's in love with you already.&quot;
Susan's tone was very solemn.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane merely laughed.</p>

<p class="indent">Then the door-bell rang, and she had to
run. Presently she was back, a little
breathless. &quot;It's Mrs. Mead and her
daughter. Can you come down?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, in a minute. You say, in a
minute.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane ran down again with the message.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Most remarkable,&quot; said Mrs. Mead,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;70]</span>
now dressed for calling, with her black
hair put back in three even crinkles on
either side, &quot;about your aunt, you know,
I mean. Why, we looked upon her as 'most
dead. You know, Emily, we've always
been given to understand she was nearing
her end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It does an invalid a lot of good to have
something new to think about,&quot; said Jane.
&quot;I'm very enlivening. Aunt Susan just
couldn't help getting up, when she heard
me upsetting her house in all directions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I expect it was enough to make her
nervous,&quot; said Mrs. Mead, sincerely. &quot;How
long are you going to stay?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Until Aunt Matilda comes back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't believe she'll like these changes,&quot;
said Mrs. Mead, gravely. &quot;I should think
that you'd feel a good deal of responsibility.
It's no light matter to leave a
shut-up house and an invalid in bed to a
niece and come home to find the house
open and the invalid all over it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And a man coming in and having waffles
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;71]</span>
in the morning,&quot; said Emily Mead, with a
smile meant to be arch.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane laughed. &quot;That was dreadful,
wasn't it?&quot; she said, twinkling&mdash;&quot;it was
all so impromptu and funny. And everybody
had such a good time. It just popped
into my head, and you see it's my religion
to have to do anything that you think will
make people happy, if you see a chance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, we've heard about your religion,&quot;
said Mrs. Mead; &quot;dear me, I should think
you'd get into a lot of trouble! Waffles in
the morning would upset some folks, except
on Sunday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps most people haven't enough
religion to manage them week-days,&quot; Jane
suggested.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My aunt, Mrs. Cowmull, says Mr. Rath
could hardly eat any lunch,&quot; observed
Emily, smiling some more.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; said Jane, &quot;but I'm not
surprised. Aunt Susan couldn't, either.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Mead coughed significantly. &quot;Susan
Ralston's pretty delicate to stand many new
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;72]</span>
ideas, I should think,&quot; she began, but
stopped suddenly as Susan entered, and
viewed her with an expression of shocked
surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Mrs. Ralston, I'd no idea you
were so well. Where have you kept yourself
these last years, if you were so well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In my own room,&quot; said Susan, with
dignity. &quot;I didn't see no special call to
come down. Matilda knew where everything
was, but Jane doesn't, so I've changed
my ways for a little.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane took her hand and pressed it affectionately.
The sunshine seeds were sprouting
finely. &quot;Don't you want to come out
into the garden with me?&quot; she asked Emily
Mead, and Emily rose at once. &quot;I thought
auntie would enjoy visiting alone with her
old friend,&quot; she added, as they passed
through the hall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What are you, anyway?&quot; Emily asked
curiously. &quot;I've heard you were a trained
nurse,&mdash;are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm one of the brand-new women,&quot;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;73]</span>
said Jane; &quot;not a Suffragette, nor an advanced
anything, but just a creature who
means to give her life up to teaching happiness
as an art.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I heard that. But how do you do
it?&quot; asked Emily Mead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;By being happy and thinking happy
thoughts and doing happy things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily considered. &quot;But don't you ever
have hard things to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never. I enjoy them all&mdash;I love to
work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily looked at her wonderingly. &quot;But
washing dishes?&mdash;We don't keep a girl,
and I hate washing dishes. What would
you say to them?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane laughed. &quot;What, those two lovely
tin pans and that nice boiling kettle?
And all the dirty plates sinking under the
soap-suds and then piling up under the clean
hot water. And the shining dryness and
the putting them on the shelves all in their
own piles. And then the knowing that
God wanted those dishes washed, and that
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;74]</span>
you've done them just exactly as He'd
like to see them done. Why, I think dish-washing
is grand!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily opened her eyes widely. &quot;How
funny you are! I never heard such talk
before! But, then, you've lived in a big
city and learned to think in a big way.
You wouldn't see dish-washing so if you'd
done it all your life and never been told it
was nice. You couldn't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you've been told now,&quot; said Jane,
&quot;and no work need ever seem horrid to you
again. Just look at it in my way after
this.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But all work seems horrid to me. I'd
like to marry an awfully rich man and never
see this place again. I hate it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane thought a minute; then said in
sweet, low, even tones: &quot;You won't evolve
any man fit to marry out of that spirit, you
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The other girl stared at her. &quot;Evolve!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. Don't you know that every
minute in this world is the result of all the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;75]</span>
minutes that have gone before, and that
who we marry is part of a result&mdash;not
just an accident?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>What?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't you know that? Don't you
understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a bit. Tell me what you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's too long to explain right this
minute, because one can't tell such things
quickly, and if you've never studied them,
you haven't the brain-cells to receive them.
You see brain-cells are the houses for
thoughts, and they have to be built and
ready before the thoughts can move in.
That's what they told me, when I was
learning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily looked at her in bewilderment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's very interesting,&quot; said Jane. &quot;I
think that it's the most interesting thing
in the whole world. You see, I didn't
have any life at all; I was an orphan and
not very bright. And then I happened
to get hold of a book that said that all the
life there was in the world was mine, if
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;76]</span>
I'd just take it. So I wrote to the man who
wrote the book&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How did you ever dare?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, I knew that the man who wrote
that book would help any one&mdash;he couldn't
have written the book if he hadn't been
made to help people&mdash;and I asked him
how I could begin.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did he answer?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He said: 'Seize every chance to prove
your mind the master of your own body
first, and when you are thoroughly master
of yourself, you can master all else.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What did he mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I took it that he meant me to do
anything that I thought of, right off, and
that if I got in the habit of sweeping all
work out of my small way, I'd soon be
given a chance at big work in a big way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And were you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. I began to get through so quick&mdash;I
lived with an uncle and helped his wife
with the sewing and the children&mdash;that
I had some spare time, and I went into the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;77]</span>
kitchen and learned to cook. Then one of
the children was ill, and the doctor thought
I'd make a good nurse, so he got me into a
hospital, and I met a woman there who had
all the books that I wanted to read and who
just took hold and helped me right out.
I saw that I didn't want to be a sick-nurse,
because there's such a lot of humbug and
such a lot that's silly, and my friend said
that I was one who would evolve opportunities&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What does that mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Evolve means to sort of develop out of
the world and yourself together at the same
time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, if you want anything, you want it
because it's there, and you can get it if you've
got the strength and perseverance to build
a road to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>What!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean just what I say. We can get
anything, if we have sufficient will-power
to build a way right straight to it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;78]</span>
&quot;Suppose I want to marry a millionaire?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would mean a lot of well-directed
effort, and the effort would slowly train
you to want something much better than
to live rich and idle.&quot; Jane paused a
minute, and Emily looked at her curiously.
&quot;If you want to marry a millionaire bad
enough to start in and make yourself all
over new, you'll have such control over
your future that I think you'll get something
much better than a millionaire.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never heard any one like you in all my
life,&quot; said Emily Mead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'd be so glad to help you straight
along,&quot; Jane said. &quot;I've got two books
with me, and you can read one and then the
other. Then you'll get where you can get
the meaning out of the Bible, and then
you'll begin to see the meaning of everything.
The world gets so wonderful. You
see miracles everywhere. You feel so well.
The sun shines so bright. Life becomes so
lovely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily looked at her with real wonder.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;79]</span>
&quot;How did you happen to come here?&quot; she
asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that came long after all the rest of
the story. One day I remembered that
my mother had two sisters, and I wrote
to them. My letter arrived just as Aunt
Matilda's arm began to trouble her, and
she asked me if I could come for a visit.
You see that was another opportunity I
evolved.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily seized her hand impulsively. &quot;I'm
so glad that you came. I'm going to try,
and you'll help me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed, I will. Would you like
one of the books right now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I should.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll get it for you, and then I'll tell you
some day about the doctor I met and his
Sunshine Order.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They went towards the house. &quot;You
mustn't expect to understand everything
right off, you know,&quot; Jane said to her
gently. &quot;You see this is all new to you,
and that means that you can't any more
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;80]</span>
understand right off than you could paint
a picture right off. You have to learn
gradually.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I mean to learn,&quot; said Emily.</p>

<p class="indent">They went in the door, and Jane ran upstairs
and fetched the book. &quot;There!&quot;
she said, &quot;you read it, and I'll help you
all I can. You see the thing is to learn
with your whole heart to do God's will,
and then, in some strange, subtle way,
you get to feel what is coming and to sort
of shape all. It's so fascinating and thrilling
to realize that what you want is marching
towards you as fast as you can march
towards it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you want?&quot; Emily asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to do exactly what I'm doing,&quot;
said Jane, very quietly. &quot;I've passed wanting
anything else. I want lots of chances
to teach and help,&mdash;that's all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't you want to marry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no,&mdash;I want to be able to teach
and help everywhere. I don't want things
for myself, somehow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;81]</span>
&quot;How strange!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They went into the sitting-room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Jane,&quot; Susan cried, &quot;how I have
enjoyed hearing about everybody in town!
Sister never told me about Eddy King's
running off with the store cash or Mrs.
Wilton's daughter going to cooking-school,
or one thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We must be going,&quot; said Mrs. Mead,
rising; &quot;we'll come again, though. It's
good to see you up, Mrs. Ralston, and I
only hope you may stay up. You know
Katie Croft's mother-in-law got up just as
you have and then had a stroke that night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, is old Mrs. Croft dead?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, she isn't,&quot; said Mrs. Mead; &quot;if
she was, she wouldn't be such a warning
as she is.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear, dear,&quot; said Susan, &quot;think of all
I've missed. Has she got it just in her
legs or all over? Matilda never told me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Legs,&quot; said Mrs. Mead, &quot;and it's
affected her temper. Katie has an awful
time with her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;82]</span>
&quot;Dear, dear,&quot; said Susan again,&mdash;&quot;and,
oh, Jane, a boy I've known since he was a
baby has had his skull japanned and nearly
died. Matilda's never told me a thing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, she didn't know much, you know,&quot;
said Mrs. Mead; &quot;she kept herself about as
close as she kept you. We were given to
understand pretty plainly that we weren't
wanted to call.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Think of that now,&quot; said Susan, &quot;and
me up-stairs, feeling all my friends had
forgot me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everybody'll come now,&quot; said Mrs.
Mead; &quot;folks will be glad to see you so
well. We were told you never got up and
hardly ate enough to keep a cat.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An ordinary cat,&quot; corrected Emily;
&quot;Miss Matilda's always told what a lot
your cat ate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is an eater,&quot; said Susan, crinkling
a bit about the eyes; &quot;but I eat, too, now, I
can tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After they were gone, Jane came back
into the sitting-room. Her aunt was standing
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;83]</span>
by the window. &quot;It's so beautiful to
be down-stairs,&quot; she said, without turning.
&quot;My goodness, and to think that only a
week ago I laid up-stairs wanting to die.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can thank Aunt Matilda that you
didn't die,&quot; said Jane, going and putting her
arm around her. &quot;If she had kept you
thinking of all the illnesses in town, you'd
have died long ago. Sick thoughts are
more catching than diseases. But we don't
need to talk of that now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, indeed we don't,&quot; said Susan,
&quot;for there's Mr. Rath coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane gave a little start. &quot;I wonder what
for,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What for!&quot; Susan's tone was full of
deep meaning; &quot;why, he's fallen dead in
love with you, Jane, that's what it means,
and I don't wonder, for you're the nicest
girl I ever saw.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Auntie!&quot; said Jane, quite red.
&quot;The very idea!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;84]</span></p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="h2a">LORENZO RATH</p>

<p class="indent">IT wasn't to be supposed for a minute that
Lorenzo Rath, a real live young man
and an artist, shouldn't take first place
in the town talk. Jane's remarkable religion
might attract the attention of a few
who were sufficiently religious themselves
to be naturally shocked over the waffles
and depressed over the invalid's recovery,
but Lorenzo was of interest to every one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If he ain't took already, there's a fine
chance for Emily,&quot; Mr. Cattermole said
benevolently to his daughter. Being a man,
he naturally supposed that Mrs. Mead
would never have come by such an idea if
she hadn't had a bright old father to point
it out to her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Emily doesn't want to marry,&quot; said
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;85]</span>
Mrs. Mead, compressing her lips and expanding
her dignity simultaneously; &quot;she
wouldn't marry an artist, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maybe he ain't much of an artist,&quot; said
Mr. Cattermole, with a tendency to look
on the bright side. &quot;Why don't Emily
want to marry? I thought girls always
wanted to marry. They did when I was
young.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's different nowadays,&quot; said Mrs.
Mead, with condescending reserve. &quot;You
don't understand, Father, but nothing is
like it used to be. The world is getting
all changed. When Emily was an only
child, she was looked upon as very odd,
but most women have an only child nowadays.
Life is quite different.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'd like to see Emily married,&quot; said Mr.
Cattermole, thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Emily has had plenty of chances,&quot;
said her mother, waving the brave, tattered
mother-lie that seems to cover over such
cruel wounds.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has she really?&quot; said Mr. Cattermole,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;86]</span>
in genuine surprise. &quot;I didn't know that.
And she wouldn't have 'em! Laws sakes!
Who, for instance?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No one you knew,&quot; said his daughter,
telling the truth then.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sarah knew 'em, I suppose?&quot; (Sarah
was Mrs. Cowmull.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no one Sarah knew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Think of that now! Why, I s'posed
there wasn't nothing Sarah didn't know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In voicing this opinion Mr. Cattermole
voiced the town opinion, too. It was
popularly supposed that Sarah Cowmull
always knew everything. But she didn't
know the status of Lorenzo Rath's heart,
and Lorenzo Rath himself puzzled her not a
little.</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo puzzled everybody, mainly because
he was so open and simple that even
a child must have suspected him of keeping
something back. Such frankness was unthinkable,
such innocence incredible.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, he's gallivanting all over with
Madeleine, and yet she's gotten another
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;87]</span>
man's picture on her table!&quot; said Miss
Debby to Katie Croft.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And he's skipping in Mrs. Ralston's
gate at all hours,&quot; said Katie Croft&mdash;&quot;no
kind of ceremony to him. The other day
he see mother in the window, and he waved
his hat at her and give her an awful turn.
She don't see well, and thought he threw a
stone at her. She ain't used to city ways;
she's used to country ways. I had to let
her smell camphor for a good hour, and
while she was smelling, the kitchen fire
went out. I wish he'd keep his hat on
his head another time. My life's hard
enough without having a artist suddenly
set to, to cheer up mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you think of Mrs. Ralston's
niece? Think she's nice?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nice! With Susan Ralston about as
lively as a cricket! I don't think much of
such new ways. I don't know whatever
Matilda will say. She's just got life all
systematized, and now here's Susan up and
out of bed. I'm so scared the girl'll come
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;88]</span>
over and go at mother, I don't know what
to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My, suppose Mrs. Croft was to be up
and about!&quot; said Miss Debby, opening
her eyes widely. &quot;Whatever would you
do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do! I know what I'd do.&quot; Young
Mrs. Croft looked dark and mysterious.
&quot;I know just exactly what I'll do. And
I'm all ready to do it, and if I'm interfered
with, I will do it,&mdash;good and quick,
too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How is old Mrs. Croft now?&quot; Miss
Debby asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, she's grabbin' as ever. I never see
such a disposition. She's always catching
at me or the cat or something. Seems to
consider it a way of attracting attention.
Crazy folks has such crazy ideas, and she's
crazy,&mdash;crazy as a loon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katie Croft took up her market basket
and went on up the street. Miss Debby
stayed behind to wait for the noon mail.
&quot;Katie's so bitter,&quot; she said to herself,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;89]</span>
shaking her head; &quot;she ought to be more
grateful for being supported.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Debby forgot that there are few
things so irritating in this world as being
supported. It is a situation which has
become especially unpopular lately, particularly
with women and political motives.</p>

<p class="indent">But no old worn-out aphorism held for
one minute in the breezy bloom of the House
Where Jane Lived.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I'm so happy,&quot; Susan exclaimed
many times daily, &quot;I'm so happy. I never
felt nothing like your sunshining in all my
life before, you Sunshine Jane, you! I
feel like my own cupboards, all unlocked
and aired and nice and used again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane stopped caroling as she kneaded
bread and laughed&mdash;which sounded equally
pleasant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm as happy as you are, Auntie; it's
so nice to be in heaven.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I used to think maybe I'd die suddenly
and find myself there some day,&quot; said
Susan. &quot;I'm glad I didn't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;90]</span>
&quot;It's better to live suddenly than to die
suddenly,&quot; said Jane, merrily; &quot;when people
are awfully bothered sometimes, I've
heard their friends say: 'But if you died
suddenly, it would work out somehow,'
and I wanted to say: 'Why not live suddenly
instead of dying suddenly, and then everything's
bound to come out splendidly.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Jane, what a grand idea,&mdash;to
live suddenly! That's what I've done,
surely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jane, &quot;that's what I did, too.
Instead of fading out of life, we just bloomed
into life. It's just as easy, and a million
times more fun.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And it's all so awfully agreeable,&quot; said
Susan. &quot;My things look so nice, all set
different, and it's so pleasant having folks
coming in, and I like it all, and we haven't
to fuss with the garden.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I attend to the garden!&quot; cried a
voice outside, and a mysterious hand shoved
a basket of peas over the window-ledge.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know who that is,&quot; said Susan; &quot;it's
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;91]</span>
that boy, and he's smelt cinnamon rolls and
come to lunch. How do you do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo, brown and merry, was getting in
at the window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, you've really been weeding!&quot;
exclaimed Susan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course! I've tended the garden ever
since you gave it up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I declare! Well, I never. Jane, we
must give him a bite of something.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that's what I came for,&quot; said
Lorenzo, cheerfully, &quot;cookies, jelly-roll,&mdash;anything
simple and handy. Madeleine
and I were out walking, discussing our
affairs, and when I stopped for the garden,
she went on for her mail. I'm awfully
hungry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;People say you're engaged to her,&quot;
said Susan. Jane turned to get the tin of
cookies.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, naturally. People say so much.
She is a pretty girl, isn't she?&mdash;but then
there's Emily Mead. I must look at
myself on all sides and consider carefully.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;92]</span>
Old Mr. Cattermole took me to drive
yesterday and told me that he was healthy
and his dead wife was healthy and that,
except for what killed him, Mr. Mead was
healthy, too; and there was Emily, perfectly
healthy and the only grandchild,
and why didn't I come over often,&mdash;it
wasn't but a step.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you do beat all,&quot; said Susan.
Jane offered the tin of cookies. Lorenzo
took six. They were all laughing.</p>

<p class="indent">Later, when he'd gone away, Susan said,
almost shyly this time: &quot;Jane, I don't
want to interfere, but he <i>is</i> in love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With Madeleine?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;With you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Auntie,&quot; Jane came to her side, &quot;you
mustn't speak in that way about me.
I can't marry,&mdash;not possibly. I'm a Sunshine
Nurse, and I shall be a Sunshine Nurse
till I die. I'll make homes happy, but I
shall never have one of my own.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan looked frightened and timid. &quot;But
why?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;93]</span>
&quot;For many reasons. And all good ones.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was that in the young girl's tone
that ended the subject for the time being.</p>

<p class="indent">But Susan thought of it a great deal, and
alone in her room that night, Jane thought,
too. She had made herself ready for bed,
and then sat down by the window, clasping
her hands on the sill. Lorenzo Rath was
buoyantly dear and jolly, and she realized
that he was the nicest man that she had
ever met. It had all been fun, great fun,
and she had enjoyed it mightily. But with
all her learning Jane was not so very much
farther along the Highway to Happiness
than some others. In many cases she was
only a holder of keys as yet&mdash;the distinct
knowledge to be gained by unlocking secrets
with their aid was as yet not hers. To hold
the keys and look at the doors is to realize
what power means,&mdash;but to unlock is to
use it. Jane was still a novice; she left the
doors locked and was content to hold the
keys, and no more.</p>

<p class="indent">The next night Lorenzo appeared again.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;94]</span>
&quot;I'm half-dead,&quot; he said. &quot;I've tramped
twelve miles, sketching.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear, dear,&quot; said Susan, &quot;seems like
nobody in this world ever wants what's close
to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sometimes it's no use to want what's
close to,&quot; said Lorenzo, &quot;or else what's
close to is like Emily Mead, and you just
ache to run.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Emily Mead is a very nice girl,&quot; said
Jane, in a tone clearly reproachful.</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo just laughed. But then Susan
made some excuse to slip away. &quot;I wonder
if you'd help me a little,&quot; he said then,
hesitating a bit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is it something that I can do? Of
course I'll help you if I can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's something very necessary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Necessary?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To my welfare and happiness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think&mdash;I'm&mdash;falling in love.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; Jane was carefully tranquil.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've never really been in love in my
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;95]</span>
life, so I can't be sure. But I think it's
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane said nothing. The room was getting
dark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've never seen any one so pretty in all
my life as Miss Mar,&quot; said the young artist,
slowly. &quot;You know we're old friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, she's lovely,&quot; said Jane, with sudden
fervor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought that we might make up
little picnics and walks and things?&quot; hesitated
the young man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course,&quot; said Jane, heartily. &quot;And
you can come here all you like. Auntie likes
you both so much.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo Rath stood by the door. &quot;Were
you ever in love?&quot; he asked bluntly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Jane. &quot;I've never had the
least little touch of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haven't you ever thought about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I've never had time. I've never
seen any man that I could or would
marry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;96]</span>
&quot;Never.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's too bad,&quot; said Lorenzo Rath
slowly. &quot;Seems to me you'd make such a
splendid wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She laughed a little. Then she had to
wink quickly to drive back tears which
leapt suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I won't say any more,&quot; said Lorenzo.
She thought that he did not care to speak of
Madeleine to her.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she went. And later she found
herself sitting in her own room again, sitting
by the same window, thinking.
&quot;Poor Emily Mead and her illusory millionaire!
I'm about as silly as she is,&quot;
thought Jane. &quot;And yet I know it's
higher and more beautiful to make life
lovely for others than to make it lovely
for one's self.&quot; She sighed because the reflection&mdash;all
altruistic as it was&mdash;was
not quite the truth, and she was true enough
herself to feel jarred by the slightest cross-shadow
of falsehood. Truth plays as
widely and freely as the sunbeams themselves
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;97]</span>
and goes as straight to the heart
of each and all.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally she opened a little book and read
aloud a few pages to herself in a low tone.
&quot;I know I'm on the right path,&quot; she said,
when she had closed the book; &quot;the thing
is to stick resolutely to keeping on straight
ahead. And I must be absolutely content
with all that comes. You have to be
content if you're going to grow in goodness,
for you have to know that you've been
trying and been successful.&quot; She sat still
a while longer and then rose with a deep,
long breath. &quot;Well, to-day's been something,
and to-morrow I'll be something
better, I know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The truth did shine then, and she went
to bed calmed, but was hardly stretched
down between the cool sheets when Susan
rapped at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Jane, I can't sleep. I've got to
thinking of when Matilda comes back,
and I'm scared blue.&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;98]</span></p>

<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="h2a">A NEW OUTLOOK ON MATILDA</p>

<p class="indent">THE next morning Susan looked half-sheepish
and half-anxious. &quot;I just
couldn't help it, Jane. I laid in bed so
long, thinking, and then it come over me
what life was going to be when she was
back and you gone and&mdash;well&mdash;I just
couldn't help coming. I felt awful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane was busy with breakfast. &quot;I
know, Auntie, I know. I ought to have
thought of Aunt Matilda sooner. Half
her stay is over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my, I should say it was,&quot; wailed
Susan; &quot;that's what scares me so. We're
so happy, and the time is going so fast.
It's about the most awful thing I ever
knew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane began beating eggs for an omelette.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We never were one bit alike,&quot; Susan
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;99]</span>
intoned mournfully; &quot;we were always so
different, and then when husband died,
there was just nothing to do but for us to
live together. She's my only sister, and
it's right that I should humor her, but, oh
my, what a scratch-about life she has led
me. I was getting to feel more like a
mouse than a woman&mdash;soon as I got a
bite, I'd begin to tremble and to listen and
then how I <i>did</i> run!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it will be all so different when she
comes back,&quot; Jane said cheerily. &quot;She'll
be very different, and so will you. It'll
be just like I told you last night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know,&mdash;I know. But somehow I
can't see it as you do. I'm all upset.
And I'm so happy without her. We're
so happy. The house looks beautiful.
You've just made everything over. I declare,
Jane, I never saw anything like you.
All my old things have turned new, and so
pretty. I feel like a bride. That is, I
feel like a bride when I ain't thinking of
Matilda.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;100]</span>
&quot;It looks very nice, surely,&quot; said Jane,
smiling. &quot;Your things were so pretty,
anyhow. But what I was gladdest about
was to really get it all opened up and fresh.
I didn't want any one to come while it
was so gloomy. The whole town may
call now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They do, too,&quot; said Susan, diverted
for the minute; &quot;they certainly do. Oh,
it is so nice, I so adore to hear all about
things again. Matilda just shut everybody
out. She didn't like company.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She was pretty busy, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She hadn't any more to do than you
have. She hadn't so much to do as you
have, because she didn't do a thing you do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you were ill. She was always up
and down stairs&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, she wasn't, Jane. No, she wasn't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, she had your meals to carry upstairs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't call it meals to run with a teacup.
Meals! <i>Such</i> meals! It's a wonder
I didn't die. She'd turn anything upside
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;101]</span>
down on a plate and something else upside
down on that, and call it a meal for
me. I was about sick, just from how she
fed me. If I said something was cooked
too dry, she emptied the tea-kettle into it
next time; and if I said anything was too
wet, she put on fresh coal and left it in
the oven over night. If I said the room
was too light, she shut it up as dark as a
pickpocket; and if I said it was too dark,
she turned the sun into my eyes. She's
my only sister and I must humor her, but
I've had a very hard time, Jane, and I
don't blame myself for waking up with my
teeth all of a chatter over the thought of
living with her again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane had their breakfast ready now on
the table by the window. &quot;Come and sit
down,&quot; she said; &quot;we'll talk while we eat.
It's like I told you last night,&mdash;there must
be a hitch somewhere. Of course, God has
a good reason for you and Aunt Matilda
living together. He doesn't allow accidents
in His world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;102]</span>
&quot;Perhaps He wasn't thinking. I can't
believe that anybody would deliberately
put anybody in the house with Matilda&mdash;not
if they knew Matilda. I didn't
know what she'd grown into myself when
she first came to take care of me, because
I was a little poorly. It was to save spending
on a nurse, you know. They're such
trying, prying things, nurses are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm a nurse, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My goodness, I didn't mean your kind;
I meant the regular kind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane was laughing. &quot;But I mustn't
laugh,&quot; she said, after a minute; &quot;we must
go to work. Let's see if we can find out
how it all began. Didn't you and Aunt
Matilda get on nicely at first?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan considered. &quot;Well, I don't believe
we did. She was always so very
sparing. Husband was sparing, and of
course I'd had a good many years of it,
but when your husband's gone and you've
got the property yourself and have left it to
an only sister who takes care of you, you
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;103]</span>
don't like her being even more sparing,&mdash;putting
you on skim-milk right from the first and
chopping the potato peelings in the hash.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there must have been some good
in the situation, or it wouldn't have been.
When there's a wrong situation, the cure
lies in hunting out the good, not in talking
over the bad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You won't find any good in Matilda
and me living together,&mdash;not if you hunt
till Doomsday.&quot; Susan took a big sip of
coffee and then shook her head hard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There's good in everything.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know what it was here, then.
I was all ready to die, and the doctor said
I couldn't live, and when I found out how
Matilda was counting on it, I just made up
my mind to live just to spite her. But it's
been awful hard work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane turned and seized her hand. &quot;Well,
maybe that's the reason for the situation,
then. You see if she'd been different, you'd
have died, but being a person who made
you mad, you stayed alive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;104]</span>
Susan laughed a little. &quot;I've been mad
enough, I know,&quot; she went on; &quot;it's awful
to be up-stairs the way I've been and
have to prowl down-stairs and run off with
your food like a dog in an alley. I was
always watching till I saw Matilda over
that second fence and then racing for something
to eat. I've been very hungry often
and often, Jane, very hungry indeed,&mdash;and
in my own house, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The tears came into the girl's eyes.
&quot;Poor Auntie!&quot; she said. &quot;Well, it's all
over now and won't ever come back. You
must believe me when I say so. Old conditions
never return. The wheel can't
turn backward. That mustn't be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how'll it help it when Matilda's
visit gets over?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane rested her chin on her hands and
looked out of the window. &quot;I'll have to
get you on to a plane where you can't
live as you did ever again,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;On a plane!&mdash;&quot; Susan stared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A plane is a kind of grade in life. We
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;105]</span>
keep going up them like stairs, and the
quieter and happier people live, the higher
is the plane on which they are. It's very
simple, when you come to understand it.
It's sort of like a marble staircase built
out of a marsh and on up a mountain.
You can stand down in the mud, or step
higher in the reeds, or step higher in the
water (generally it's hot water,&quot; Jane
interrupted herself to say with a little
smile). &quot;Or out on the dry earth, or
higher where it's flowers, or higher or higher.
But every time you get up a step you leave
all the mess of all the lower steps behind
you forever. Do you understand?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I don't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, don't you see that if you lift
yourself higher than your surroundings, of
course you'll have other conditions around
you and be really living another life? We
can't possibly be bound by conditions lower
than our souls. It's a law. I'll help you
to understand it, and then it will help you
to not be at all troubled over Aunt Matilda.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;106]</span>
You'll be above her. Don't you see? One
can always get out of a disagreeable life by
lifting one's self above it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I did stay up-stairs,&quot; said Susan,
with beautiful literalness. &quot;I think it's
awful to have to keep a plane above any
one, when the whole house is yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn't mean that,&quot; said Jane. &quot;I
meant that mentally you must get above
her. It isn't in words or in thoughts,&mdash;you
must <i>be</i> above her. You must get
free. I must help you. You can do it.
Anybody can do it. And as soon as you
are free in your spirit, your life will change.
Our daily life follows our thoughts. Our
thoughts make a pattern, and life weaves
it. The world of stars that we can't
hardly grasp at all is all God's thought.
The life in this house was your thought
and Aunt Matilda's.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wasn't mine,&quot; said Susan quickly;
&quot;it was hers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, it's mine now,&quot; said Jane.
&quot;That's the true business of the Sunshine
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;107]</span>
Nurses. They must get a new thought into
a house and get it to growing well. Then
they'll leave the true sunshine there forever
after.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan's eyes were very curious&mdash;very
bright. &quot;I declare I don't see how you'll
do it here,&quot; she said. &quot;I can't look at
Matilda any new way, as I know of. Whatever
she does, she does just exactly as I
don't like it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose that you try her, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I didn't die; of course she minded
that. But I couldn't die. You can't die
just to order.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, of course not; I didn't mean that.&quot;
Jane was quite serious. &quot;I don't blame
you at all for not doing that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan had finished and rose from the
table. &quot;Let's leave the dishes and go
out in the yard,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm awfully
anxious to keep on at this till we find a way
out, if you think that you can; I go about
wild when I think of her. I'm ready for
anything except staying in bed any more.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;108]</span>
&quot;Oh, that's all over,&quot; said Jane.
&quot;You're off the bed-plane now, and don't
you see how much higher you've got already?
The next step is to fix yourself
so securely on this happy one that you
know that it's yours and you can't leave
it. You see, you feel able to go back down
again, and as long as you feel that way,
it's possible. One has to bar out the wrong
kind of life forever, and then of course it's
over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she is coming back,&quot; said Susan,
&quot;and I can't live any more on gobbles of
milk and cold bits swallowed while I'm
getting up-stairs three steps to the jump.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane looked at her. &quot;I expect that
exercise was awfully good for you, Auntie,&quot;
she said seriously. &quot;You've probably gotten
a lot of health and interest out of it.
Don't forget that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, maybe; but I don't want any
more.&quot; Susan's tone was terribly earnest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's all over then,&quot; said Jane, slowly
and with emphasis; &quot;if you truly and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;109]</span>
honestly don't want any more, then it
must be all over. The thing to do now is
to build a firm connection between ourselves
and it's being all over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't quite understand what you
mean,&quot; said Susan, &quot;but something's got
to be done, of course, because otherwise
she'll come home, and oh, my, her face
when she sees me up and around!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane knit her brows. &quot;You see, Auntie,&quot;
she said slowly, &quot;there's only one thing to
do. We've got to change ourselves completely;
we've to get where we want her
to come home and where we look forward
to it&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan stopped short and lifted up both
hands. &quot;Gracious, we can't ever do that!
It isn't in humanity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, we can do it,&quot; said Jane firmly;
&quot;people can always do anything that they
can think out, and if we can think this out
straight, we can do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn't easy to see in just the first
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;110]</span>
minute, but I understand the principle of
it and I know that we can work it, for
I've seen it done. You do it by getting
an entirely new atmosphere into the house.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you've done that already,&quot; interrupted
Susan. &quot;It isn't musty anywhere
any more, and there's such a kind
of a happy smell instead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't mean that kind of an atmosphere.
I mean a change of feeling in ourselves.
We've got to somehow make ourselves
all over; we must really and truly
be different.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I am made over, and you were all
right, anyhow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I'm not all right,&quot; said Jane firmly.
&quot;I'm very wrong. I'm letting silly
thoughts with which I've no business torment
me dreadfully, and I'm not driving
them out with any kind of resolution.
Then we're both doing wrong about Aunt
Matilda. We're making a narrow little
black box of our opinion and crowding her
into it all the time. There's nothing so
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;111]</span>
dreadful as the way families just chain
one another to their faults. Outsiders
see all the nice things, and we have lots
of courage to always live up to their opinions,
but families spend most of their
time just nailing those they love best into
pretty little limits. You and I are so
happy together, and we're changing ourselves
and one another every day, but we
never think that Aunt Matilda's also having
experience and changing herself, too.
We kind of forbid her to grow better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You won't find anything that will
change Matilda very quick, Jane. She's
a dreadful person to stick to habits; she's
drunk out of the blue cup and give me the
green one for these whole five years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The change in the atmosphere of the
house,&quot; said Jane slowly, &quot;must be complete.
We must never say one more word
about her that isn't nice, and we mustn't
even think unkind thoughts. We must
talk about her lots and look forward to
her coming back&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;112]</span>
&quot;Oh, heavens, I can't,&quot; gasped Susan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We'll begin to-day on her room&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you'll make her madder than a
hatter, sure; she can't bear to have her
room touched.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm going to make it the prettiest room
in the house,&quot; said Jane resolutely. &quot;I'm
going to brush and clean and mend and fix
all those clothes she's left hanging up, and
I'm going to love her dearly from now on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan sat still, her lips moving slightly,
but whether with repressed feeling or
trembling sentiment it would be impossible
to say. &quot;She looked awful cute
when she was little and wore pantalettes,&quot;
she said finally.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bravo!&quot; cried Jane, running to her
and kissing her. &quot;There's a fine victory
for you, and now,&quot;&mdash;her face brightening
suddenly,&mdash;&quot;I've got an idea of what we
can do to lift us right straight up into a
new circle of life. What do you say to
our making the little back parlor over
into a bedroom, and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;113]</span>
&quot;&mdash;taking Mr. Rath to board?&quot; cried
Susan joyfully. &quot;Oh, I am sure that he
wanted to come all along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane laughed outright. &quot;No, indeed,
the very idea! No, what I thought of
was inviting that poor old Mrs. Croft here
for a week and giving her and her daughter-in-law
a rest from one another.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan gave a sharp little yell. &quot;Why,
Jane Grey, I never heard the beat!
Why, she can't even feed herself!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be a way to change the atmosphere
of the house; it's just the kind of
thing that would change us all&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think it would change us all,&quot;
interrupted Susan; &quot;why, she threw a
cup of tea at Katie's back last week. Katie
said she couldn't possibly imagine what
had come over her,&mdash;she was leaning out
to hook the blinds.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It would be a Bible-lovely thing to do,&quot;
Jane went on slowly. &quot;You or I could
feed her, and I'd take care of her. I'm
a nurse, you know!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;114]</span>
&quot;Jane! Well, you beat all! Well, I
never did! Old Mrs. Croft. Why, they
say you might as well be gentle with a
hornet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Maybe she has her reasons; maybe it's,&mdash;Set
a hornet to tend a hornet, for all we
know. Anyway, it's come to me as some
good to do, and when I think of any good
that I can do, I have to do it,&mdash;else it's
a sin. That's my religion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That religion of yours'll get you into
a lot of hot water along through life.&quot;
Susan's tone was very grave. &quot;And you've
never seen old Mrs. Croft, or you'd never
speak of her and religion in the same
breath. They've got a cat she caresses,
and some days she caresses it for all she's
worth. I've heard the cat being caressed
when it was quiet, myself, many's the
time. You can't use that religion of yours
on old Mrs. Croft; she isn't a subject for
religion. She's one of that kind that the
man in the Bible thanked God he wasn't
one of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;115]</span>
&quot;My religion is what brought me here
to you,&quot; said Jane gently. &quot;You aren't
really sorry that I learned it, are you,
Auntie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan's eyes moistened quickly. She
gasped, then swallowed, then made up her
mind. &quot;Well, Sunshine Jane,&quot; she said
resignedly, &quot;when shall we get her?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We'll put her room in order to-morrow
morning, and I'll go and ask her in the
afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; said Susan, with a world of
meaning in the two syllables. &quot;I hope
she'll enjoy the change.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane laughed. &quot;Goodness, Auntie, I
never saw any one pick up new ideas as
quick as you do. I was months learning
how to make myself over, and you do it in
just a few hours. You must have laid a
big foundation of self-control up there in
bed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan sighed, uncheered. &quot;It kept me
pretty sharp, I tell you,&quot; she said; &quot;when
you're always hungry and have to get
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;116]</span>
your food on the sly and be positively sure
of never being found out, it does keep you
in trim being spry pretty steady.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;May we come in?&quot; asked voices at
the gate. It was Lorenzo Rath and Madeleine.
&quot;We wanted to see how you were
getting on to-day,&quot; the latter called.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We've been changing the furniture and
the atmosphere,&quot; said Susan, trying bravely
to smile. &quot;Jane is turning everything
around and bringing the bright new side
out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you'll come and help me wash the
breakfast dishes and then make biscuits,&quot;
Jane said to Madeleine, &quot;I'll ask you both
to lunch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to learn how to do everything,
of course,&quot; said Madeleine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And why shouldn't we go down to the
garden?&quot; suggested Lorenzo to Susan.
&quot;You'll point out the things you want
to-day, and I'll pull 'em up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But there are fences to climb,&quot; said
Jane.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;117]</span>
&quot;Fiddle for fences,&quot; said her aunt;
&quot;he'll go ahead, and I'll skim over 'em like
a squirrel. I never made anything of
fences.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So they divided the labor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The house looks so pretty,&quot; said Madeleine,
as she and Jane went through to the
kitchen. &quot;How do you ever manage it,&mdash;with
just the same things, too?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane glanced about. &quot;Why, there's a
right place for everything, and if you just
stand back a bit and let the things have
time to think, they'll tell you where to put
them. There was an old blue vase in the
dining-room that was pretty weak-minded,
but I was patient and carried it all over
the place till finally it was suited on top of
the what-not in the corner of the hall.
The trouble with most things is that we
hurry them too much at first, and then we
don't help them out of their false position
later.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Jane, you are so delightfully quaint.
You must tell Mr. Rath that. It's the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;118]</span>
kind of speech that will just charm the
soul right out of an artist.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane was deep in the flour-bin. &quot;But
I don't want to charm his soul. I'll leave
that to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To me! Why, he doesn't care a rap
about me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then, to Emily Mead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Emily Mead! Oh, my dear, you have
put a lot of new ideas into her head! She
says that you told her that any one could
get anything that he or she wanted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And so they can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Suppose she wants Mr. Rath?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If she wants him in the right way,
she'll have him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't like that way of speaking of
men,&quot; said Madeleine, dipping her white
fingers into the flour and beginning to chip
the butter through it. &quot;Don't you think
it's horrid how girls speak of men nowadays?
I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I do,&quot; said Jane. &quot;But one
drops into the habit just because everybody
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;119]</span>
does it. I'll never be married myself,
and it's partly because I think it's all
being so dragged down. Instead of two
people's knowing one another and liking
one another better till finally a big, beautiful,
holy secret sort of dawns on them
and makes the world all over new, girls
just go on and act as if men were wild
animals to be hunted and caught and
talked about, or married and made fun
of. I don't think all these new ideas
and new ways for women have made
women a bit more womanly. When I had
to earn my living, I picked out work that
a man couldn't do, and that I wouldn't
be hurting any man by doing. I'm sorry
for men nowadays. And I think women
lose a lot the way some of them go on.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After all, there can't be anything nicer
than to be a woman, can there?&quot; said
Madeleine, stirring as the other poured in
ingredients. &quot;I've always been glad that
I was a woman. I think that a woman's
life is so sweet, and it's beautiful to be protected
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;120]</span>
and cared for.&quot; The pink flew over
her cheeks at the words.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane's lashes swept downward for a
minute, then rose resolutely. &quot;Or to protect
and care for others. It always seems
to me as if a woman was the sort of blessed
way through which a man's love and
strength and care go to his children. Men
are so helpless with children, but they do
such a lot for wives, and then the mothers
pass it on to the little ones.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Life's lovely when you think of it
rightly, isn't it?&quot; Madeleine said thoughtfully.
&quot;I'm so pleased over having come
here. You see Father and Mother wanted
me to spend a few weeks quietly where I
could rest and pick myself up a little, and
so they sent me here. I didn't care much
about coming, but I'm glad now. You're
doing me lots of good, Jane; you seem to
help me to unlock the doors to everything
that's just best in me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn't that I do it,&quot; said Jane; &quot;it's
that it's been done to me, and after it got
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;121]</span>
through me, it's bound to shine on. It's
like light; every window you clean lets it
through into another place, where maybe
there's something else to clean and let it
through again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose we just live to keep clean and
let light through,&quot; laughed Madeleine,
cutting out the biscuits.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think that you'd make a good
preacher, Jane; you've such nice, plain,
homely, understandable ways of putting
things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane laughed and popped the pan into
the oven. &quot;Come and help lay the table,&quot;
she said. &quot;Oh, you never saw anything
as sweet as Aunt Susan's joy in her own
things. She's like a little child at Christmas.
It's a kind of coming back to life
for her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They say that her sister was awfully
mean to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she wasn't at all. She thought
that she was sicker than she was, and she
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;122]</span>
kept her in bed, and the joke of it was that
Aunt Susan didn't like to hurt her feelings
by letting her see what mistaken ideas she
had, so she hopped up every time the coast
was clear and kept lively and interested
trying to be about and in bed at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How perfectly delightful! I never
heard anything so funny. And then you
came and discovered the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I didn't want her to stay in bed.
I'd never encourage any one in a false
belief, but she hadn't the belief,&mdash;she had
only the false appearance. She didn't
enjoy being an invalid one bit.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it's too droll,&quot; said Madeleine.
&quot;Didn't you laugh when it dawned on you
first?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It dawned on me rather sadly. But we
laugh together now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What will she do when her sister comes
back?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, that will all come out nicely. I
don't know just how, but I know that it
will come out all right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;123]</span>
&quot;Do you always have faith in things
coming out rightly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Always. I wouldn't dare not to. I'm
one of those people who kind of feel the
future as it draws near, and so I wouldn't
allow myself to feel any mean future drawing
near, on principle. I always feel that
nice things are marching straight towards
me as fast as ever the band of music plays.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you believe that it really makes any
difference?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course it makes a difference. It
makes all the difference in the world, because
hope's a rope by which any good
thing can haul you right up to it, hand
over hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You give me a lot to think about,&quot;
said Madeleine.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane ran out and picked some ivy leaves
to place under the vase of flowers in the
middle of the table. It made a little green
mat. &quot;There; we're all ready when they
come, now,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Presently they did come.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;124]</span>
&quot;Oh, what will Mrs. Cowmull say to
this!&quot; said Lorenzo, as he pulled out Mrs.
Ralston's chair. &quot;She's busy marking passages
in <i>The Seven Lamps of Architecture</i>
to read aloud to me while I eat, and now
I shan't show up at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you seen her niece lately?&quot;
asked Madeleine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I saw her this morning. She
wants to pose for me, only she stipulated
that she should wear clothes. I told her
that my models all wore thick wool and
only showed a little of their faces. She
didn't seem to like that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what did you mean? Surely you
don't always have them wear thick
woolen?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I just do. If they haven't thick wool
on, I won't paint them at all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, I paint sheep.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The mild little joke met with great favor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you're a very clever young
man,&quot; Susan said with great sincerity. &quot;To
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;125]</span>
think of me having a good time laughing
with a sheep painter,&quot; she added. &quot;Who
holds them for you to paint, and do you
set them afterwards?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I paint them right in the fields,&quot; said
Lorenzo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think they'd butt you from
behind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I paint over a fence.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, that's safe,&quot; said Jane's aunt.
&quot;If you're careful not to be on the side
where there's a bull.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After supper Madeleine helped Jane wash
the dishes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What fun you make out of everything,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's the only way,&quot; Jane answered.
&quot;My mission is to make two sunbeams
shine where only one slanted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm glad I'm one of the heathen to
whom you were sent,&quot; said Madeleine
affectionately.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane put her arm around her. &quot;So am
I, dear, very glad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;126]</span>
Madeleine laid her face against the other
girl's. &quot;Some day I want to tell you a
secret,&quot; she said; &quot;a secret that Lorenzo
told me yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane felt her heart sort of skip a beat.
&quot;Do tell me,&quot; she said in a whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't now,&quot; said Madeleine. &quot;I
want to be all alone with you. It's too&mdash;too
big a secret to bear to be broken in
upon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you come to-morrow afternoon?
Auntie's going to Mrs. Mead's to the Sewing
Society, and I'll be here alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That will be nice,&quot; said Madeleine;
&quot;yes, I'll come.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="h2a">SOUL-UPLIFTING</p>

<p class="indent">IT was the next morning about eleven
o'clock.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see,&quot; said Jane, sitting in the
Crofts' sitting-room opposite Katie Croft
who, whatever else she might or might not
be, was certainly not pleasant of expression,
&quot;you see, my aunt has been an invalid so
much that she appreciates what a change
means to both the sick one and the one
who cares for her, and so we thought that
it would be so nice if you'd let me wheel
your mother&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She ain't my mother&mdash;she's my
mother-in-law,&quot; broke in Mrs. Katie Croft,
instantly indignant over so false an imputation.
&quot;Good lands, the very idea!
My mother! And never one single stroke
of paralysis nor nothing in my family,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;128]</span>
and all reading the Bible without glasses
right up till they died.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, it would give you a little rest,
too,&quot; Jane continued, &quot;and it would do
Aunt Susan good to feel that she was
helping a weaker&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She ain't weak,&quot; broke in Katie Croft,
again; &quot;my lands, she's strong as a
lady-ox. Anything she makes up her mind
to keep she lays hold of with a grip as
makes you fairly sick all up and down your
back. You don't know perhaps, Miss
Grey, as my husband died in our youth,
and I come to live with his mother as a
sacred duty, and I tell you frankly that
I wish I'd never been born or that he'd
never been born, forty times an hour&mdash;I
do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You'll like a week alone, I'm sure,&quot;
said Jane serenely, &quot;and we'll like to
have your mother-in-law. Perhaps she'll
get a few new ideas&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She's stubborn as a mule,&quot; interrupted
the daughter-in-law.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;129]</span>
&quot;But may I see her and ask her? I do
so want to help you a little. Life must
have been so hard for you these last
years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hard!&quot; said Katie Croft, with emphasis.
&quot;Hard! Well, I'll tell you what
it is, Miss Grey,&mdash;to marry a young man
as was meek as Moses and then have him
just fade right straight out and get a
mother-in-law like that old&mdash;that old&mdash;that
old&mdash;well, I'll tell you frankly she's
a siren and nothing else.&quot; (Young Mrs.
Croft probably meant &quot;vixen,&quot; but Jane
did not notice.) &quot;My life ain't really
worth a shake-up of mustard and vinegar
some days. What I have suffered!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know more than you think,&quot; said
Jane sympathetically; &quot;nurses take care of
so many kinds of people. But do let me
ask her. If she likes to come to us, it'll
be a great rest to you, and perhaps it'll
do her a little good, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't understand you're wanting her,&quot;
said Katie. &quot;It's all over town how queer
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;130]</span>
you are, but I never thought that anybody
could be as queer as that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do let us go to her,&quot; Jane urged.</p>

<p class="indent">Katie rose and forthwith conducted the
caller to old Mrs. Croft's room, a large,
square place adorned with no end of black
daguerreotypes and faded photographs.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother, it's Miss Grey. You know?&mdash;she's
Mrs. Ralston's niece.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Old Mrs. Croft received her visitor with
acutely suspicious eyes. &quot;Well?&quot; she said
tartly.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane took her hand, but she jerked it
smartly away.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down anywhere,&quot; said Katie; &quot;she
hears well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hear!&quot; said old Mrs. Croft. &quot;I
should say I did hear. There ain't a pan
fell in the neighborhood for the last ten
years as hasn't woke me out of a sound
sleep, dreaming of my husband&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Grey's come to see you about
something,&quot; interrupted Katie; &quot;she&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had a husband,&quot; continued old Mrs.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;131]</span>
Croft, raising her voice from Do to Re,
&quot;and such a one! Wednesday he'd go to
sleep and Thursdays he'd wake, so regular
you could tell the days of the week just
from his habits. He&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Grey wants&mdash;&quot; interrupted
Katie.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I came to&mdash;&quot; said Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I had a husband,&quot; continued old
Mrs. Croft, going from Re to Mi now;
&quot;oh, my, but I did have a husband. In
May I had him and in December I had him,
but he was always the same to me. You
can see his picture there, Miss Grey; it's
all faded out, just from being looked at;
but I'll tell you where it never fades, Miss
Grey&mdash;it never so much as turns a hair
in my heart. My heart is engraved&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You'd better go on and say what you've
got to say,&quot; said Katie to Jane. &quot;I often
put her to bed talking, and she talks all
the night through.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to ask you&mdash;&quot; Jane began.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask me no questions and I'll tell
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;132]</span>
you no lies,&quot; sang Mrs. Croft. &quot;Oh, I
had&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;I want you to come and stay with
us,&quot; Jane said, with forceful accents.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a sudden tense hush.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My aunt and I want you to come and
make us a little visit,&quot; the caller added.</p>

<p class="indent">The hush grew awful.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A little change would be so good for
you&mdash;you've been shut up so long.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Old Mrs. Croft lifted her two hands
towards the ceiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you want to take me out of
my own house for? Going to do something
to it that I wouldn't approve, I
expect. Oh, I see it all. There was Macbeth
and there was Othello, and now there's
my house&mdash;What are you going to do to
it, anyhow?&quot; The question was pitched
so high and sharp that Jane jumped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We just want to give you a little
change.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Change! I had a change once. Went
to Cuba with my husband and nearly died.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;133]</span>
I don't want no change of <i>house</i>,&quot; with
deep meaning in the emphasis; &quot;the
change that I want is another change.
Change is a great thing to have. My husband
never changed. Only his collars.
Never no other way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You and Aunt Susan are old friends&mdash;&quot;
suggested Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never nothing special,&quot; broke in old
Mrs. Croft. &quot;My goodness, I do hope
your aunt ain't calling me her friend,
because if she is, it's a thing I can't allow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane thanked her stars that her powers
of mental concentration forbade her mind
to wander. &quot;I'm sure if you came to us,
you'd enjoy it,&quot; she said persuasively;
&quot;we've such a pretty bedroom down-stairs,
and I'll sleep on the dining-room sofa, so
you won't feel lonely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lonely. I never feel lonely. I'd thank
Heaven if I could be let alone for a little,
once in a while. I don't want to come,
and that's a fact. If that be treason,
make the most of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;134]</span>
&quot;Oh, but you must come,&quot; said Jane;
&quot;you'll like it. We want you, and you
must come.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, get me my bonnet then,&quot; said
old Mrs. Croft. &quot;Run, Katie, I've been
sitting here waiting for it for over an hour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katie and Jane regarded one another
in consternation. They hadn't quite
counted on this.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm going visiting,&quot; said Mrs. Croft
gaily. &quot;Oh, my, and how I shall visit.
Years may come and years may go, and
still I shall sit there visiting away, and
when I hear the door-bell, I shall know
it's time for Christmas dinner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Katie took Jane's hand and drew her
out of the room. &quot;I don't believe you'd
better take her,&quot; she said; &quot;she's so flighty.
I know how to manage her, and you don't.
Just give it up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I won't,&quot; said Jane, smiling. &quot;I
know that it's a kind thing to do and that
I must do it. I'm going to take her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Seems so odd you're wanting to,&quot; said
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;135]</span>
Katie. &quot;You're very funny, I think.
People are saying that you think that
everything's for the best. Do you really
believe that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course. We can't get outside of
God's plan, whatever we may do. If we
do wrong, we have to bear the consequences
because it's as easy to <i>see</i> the right thing
to do as the wrong, but the great Plan
never wavers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my,&quot; said Katie. &quot;I'm glad to
know that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane pressed her hand. &quot;I'll get things
all ready, and we'll bring her over tomorrow
night,&quot; she said; &quot;that'll be best.
Then she can go right to bed and get rested
from the effort.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So it was arranged, and the Sunshine
Nurse went home to tell Susan that Mrs.
Croft had consented to come. She felt
quite positive that now they would both
attain unto a higher plane without any
difficulty, if they kept such a guest in the
house for a week.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;136]</span>
&quot;It isn't going to be easy, Auntie,&quot; she
said, a bit later, &quot;but it will teach you and
me a lot, and if one wants to voyage greatly,
one must get out into the deep water.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll do anything to get hold of some
different way of getting on with Matilda,&quot;
said Susan, &quot;and I begin to see what you
mean when you say that if I change <i>me</i>,
I'll change it all. If you could make flour
into sugar, you'd have cake instead of
biscuit, but, oh, my! Old Mrs. Croft!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It won't be for so very long,&quot; said
Jane, &quot;and think of Katie Croft through
all these years! She's been splendid, I
think.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, she didn't have any other place
to live, you know,&quot; Susan promptly reminded
her niece.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Work's work, no matter why you do it,&quot;
Jane said, &quot;and all the big laws work
greatly. This having old Mrs. Croft is a
pretty big step for you and me to take,
and you'll see that when Aunt Matilda
returns, we'll be so strongly settled in our
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;137]</span>
new ways that she can't unsettle us. We'll
be absolutely different people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Y&mdash;yes,&quot; said Susan, confidence fighting
doubt stoutly. &quot;I'm willing to try,
although left to myself I should never
have thought of old Mrs. Croft as a way of
getting different.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anything that we do with earnest
purpose is a way of getting better,&quot; said
Jane. She looked out of the window for
a minute, and her lip almost quivered.
Susan didn't notice. &quot;Everything is always
for the best, if we're sure of it,&quot; she
then said firmly.</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="h2a">MADELEINE'S SECRET</p>

<p class="indent">THE two girls were enjoying a pleasant
time in Susan's big, tidy kitchen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never knew that a kitchen could be so
perfectly lovely,&quot; said Madeleine, as they
took tea by the little table by the window.
&quot;Jane, you are a genius! One opens the
gate here with a bubbling feeling that
everything in the whole world's all right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm so glad,&quot; said Jane; &quot;it's grand to
feel that one is a real channel of happiness.
I always seem to see people as made to
form that kind of connection between God
and earth, and that happiness is the visible
sign of success, a good 'getting through,'
so to speak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you know, the English language is
awfully indefinite. That sentence might
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;139]</span>
mean good flowing like water through
people, or people so made that good can
go through them easily. Do you see?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I see. But either meaning is all
right. It isn't what I say that matters
so much, anyway. It's how you take it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I took that two ways.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and both were good. That's so
fine,&mdash;to get two good meanings, where
I only meant one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They smiled together.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Rath and I were talking about
that last evening,&quot; said Madeleine, the
color coming into her face a little. &quot;Do
you know, he's really a very dear man.
He's awfully nice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane jumped up to drive a wasp out of
the window. &quot;You know him better than
I do,&quot; she said, very busy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've known him for several years, but
never as well as here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane came back and sat down. Madeleine
was silent, seeming to search for
words.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;140]</span>
&quot;You were going to tell me a secret,&quot;
her friend said, after a little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know, but I&mdash;I can't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane lifted her eyes almost pitifully.
&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't feel that I have the right, after
all. Secrets are such precious things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I can help you&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no, no.&mdash;It isn't any trouble.
It's something quite different&mdash;I&mdash;I
thought that perhaps I could tell you my
thoughts, but&mdash;I can't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are such wonderful feelings in the
world,&quot; Madeleine went on, after a little;
&quot;they don't seem to fit into words at all.
One feels ashamed to have even planned
to talk about them. One feels so humble
when&mdash;&quot; she paused&mdash;then closed her
lips.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane put out her hand and took the hand
upon the other side of the little table, close.
&quot;Don't mind me, dear; I understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you really?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;141]</span>
&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine's eyes were anxious. &quot;Do
you guess? Did you guess?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And how&mdash;what&mdash;what do you
think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think that it would be lovely, only, of
course, I don't quite know it all, for I shall
never have anything like it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine started. &quot;Oh, Jane, don't say
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it's so, dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, <i>no</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, dear,&mdash;I can guess and sympathize.
But I shall never have any such happiness.
It's&mdash;it's quite settled.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine left her seat, went round by
the side of the other girl, flung herself
down on the floor, and looked as if she were
about to cry. &quot;Oh, Jane, you mustn't
feel so. Why shouldn't you marry?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't, dear; I've debts of my father's
to pay, and I'm pledged to my Order.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But they'll get paid after a while.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;142]</span>
&quot;It will take all my youth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But a way can be found?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No way can ever be. There is no one
in the wide world to help me. I'm quite
alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Jane,&quot; said Madeleine, always
kneeling and always looking up, &quot;I know
some one who can manage everything, and
you do, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane stared a little. &quot;My aunt, do you
mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&mdash;God.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane smiled suddenly. &quot;Thank you, dear.
I hadn't forgotten, but I just didn't think.
Still, I think God means me to be brave
about my burdens. I don't think that He
sees them as things from which to be
relieved.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madeleine was still looking up. &quot;But
the channel doesn't think; the channel
just conveys what pours along it,&quot; she
whispered.</p>

<p class="indent">Just at this second the scene altered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, there's my aunt!&quot; Jane exclaimed.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;143]</span>
Susan passed the window, and the next
minute she came in the door. &quot;I've had
the most bee&mdash;youtiful afternoon,&quot; she
announced radiantly. &quot;I did Jane lots of
credit, for I never said a word about anybody,
but oh, how splendid it was to just
be good and silent, and hear all the others
talk. They talked about everybody, and
a good many were of my own opinion, so I
had considerable satisfaction without doing
a thing wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane couldn't help laughing or Madeleine,
either. &quot;Was young Mrs. Croft there?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, and most everybody says that she'll
go off to-morrow and never come back, and
we'll have old Mrs. Croft till she dies.
They looked at me pretty hard, but I
stuck to my soul and never said a word.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was noble in you, Auntie,&quot; Jane said
warmly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, it was,&quot; assented Susan. Then
she turned to Madeleine, who had returned
to her chair. &quot;Jane's religion's pretty hard
on me, but I like its results, and I can do
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;144]</span>
anything I set out to do, and I don't mean
to not get a future if I can help it. You
see, my sister Matilda is a very peculiar
person. You must know that by this
time?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have heard a good deal about her,&quot;
Madeleine admitted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I hope it isn't unkind in me to
say that I know more than anybody else
can possibly imagine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she's coming back all right,&quot; Jane
interrupted firmly; &quot;we mustn't forget
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Susan, with a quick gasp in
her breath; &quot;no, I'm not forgetting a
thing. I'm only talking a little. And oh,
how Mrs. Cowmull did talk about you,
Madeleine. She says Mr. Rath can't put
his nose out of the door alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's dreadful,&quot; said Madeleine, trying
not to color, &quot;especially as we always
come straight here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I tell you it's pretty hard work
being good,&quot; said Susan, with a cheerful
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;145]</span>
sigh; &quot;it's a relief to get home and take off
one's bonnet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And don't you want some tea, Auntie?
It's all hot under the cozy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I will, you Sunshine Jane, you.
I'll never cease to be grateful for good tea
again as long as I live. I've had five years
of the other kind to help me remember.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Later, when Madeleine was gone, Susan
said: &quot;Do you know, Jane, Katie Croft is
certainly going to desert that awful old
woman when we get her here? Everybody
says so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, she isn't, Auntie; the expected is
never what happens.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jane, any one with your religion can't
rely on proverbs to help them out, because
the whole thing puts you right outside of
common-sense to begin with.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane was sitting looking out upon the
pretty garden. &quot;I know, Auntie; I only
quoted that in reference to the Sewing
Society gossip. It's never the expected
that happens in their world; it's the expected
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;146]</span>
that always happens in my world.
And proverbs don't exist in my world; they're
every one of them a human limitation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Jane, I don't know; some of
them are very pretty, and when I've seen
Matilda over the fence and run down to
get a few scraps, I've taken considerable
comfort in 'No cloud without a silver
lining' and 'It never rains but it pours.'
They were a great help to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane kissed her tenderly. &quot;Bless you,
Auntie,&mdash;everything's all right and all
lovely, and Madeleine made me so happy
to-day. I'm sure that she's engaged.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I've thought that, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and I'm so glad for her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope he's good enough for her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I'm sure that he is.&quot; Jane thought
a minute. &quot;And Madeleine gave me a big
lesson, too,&quot; she added.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She showed me that with all my teaching
and preaching, I don't trust God half
enough yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;147]</span>
&quot;Well, Jane,&quot; said Susan solemnly, &quot;I
s'pose trusting God is like being grateful
for the sunshine,&mdash;human beings ain't big
enough to hold all they ought to feel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps we'd be nothing but trust and
gratitude, then,&quot; said Jane, smiling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They're nice feelings to be made of,&quot;
said Susan serenely, &quot;but I must go and
put my bonnet away. But, oh, heavens,
when I think that to-morrow old Mrs.
Croft is coming!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And that lots of good is coming with
her; she is coming to bring happiness and
happiness only.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Susan's air was completely
submissive. &quot;I can hardly wait
for her to get here. They wondered at the
Sewing Society if she'd sing Captain Jinks
all night often. She does sometimes, you
know. But I'm sure we'll like her. She's
a nice woman.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="h2a">OLD MRS. CROFT</p>

<p class="indent">OLD Mrs. Croft arrived the next afternoon
about half after four. She was
rolled up in her chair, and her small trunk
followed on a wheelbarrow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How old you have grown!&quot; she said
to Susan, by way of greeting, as she grated
up the gravel. &quot;My, to think you ever
looked young!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They wheeled her into the hall. &quot;Same
hall,&quot; she said, looking about, &quot;same
paper you had thirty years ago. Oh, my,
to think of it. I've papered and papered
and scraped off, and papered and papered
and scraped off, and then papered again in
those same thirty years.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They got her into the room on the ground
floor, which had been prepared for her.
&quot;I suppose this was the most convenient
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;149]</span>
place to put me,&quot; she said, &quot;and so you
put me in it. Put me where you please,
only I do hope you haven't beetles. It
makes me very nervous to hear 'em chipping
about all night, and when I'm nervous, I
don't sleep, and when I don't sleep, I just
can't help lying awake. It's a way I've
got. I caught it from my husband when
he was a baby. He'd wake up and give
it to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan went out with Jane to get her some
supper. &quot;I never thought much about
Katie Croft,&quot; she said, &quot;but I never doubted
she had a hard time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jane, &quot;and one of the nicest
things in this world is to be able to give
some one who's had a hard time a rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wouldn't it be dreadful if she died,
though, while she was here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who? Old Mrs. Croft?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no, she won't ever die. I meant
Katie. Everybody says she's going to run
away, but if she don't do that and dies,
we'll be just as badly off as if she did it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;150]</span>
&quot;Oh, Auntie!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Jane, we'd have to keep old Mrs.
Croft till she died.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess there's not much chance of
that,&quot; Jane said; &quot;she won't die. She
has come here to do us good and to receive
good herself, that's all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan looked appalled. &quot;Surely you
don't expect to sunshine <i>her</i> up, do you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Susan looked amazed. &quot;Well, I
never did! I thought she was just here
to do us good. I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Their conversation was suddenly interrupted
by a piercing shriek. Jane flew.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm so happy I just had to let it out,&quot;
Mrs. Croft announced. &quot;I can't hold in
joy or sorrow. Sorrow I let out in the low
of my voice&mdash;like a cow, you know&mdash;but
joy I let rise to the skies. You'll hear
to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane looked at her and smiled. She
looked like a story-book witch in a nice,
white, modern bed. &quot;I thought that perhaps
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;151]</span>
you wanted something,&quot; she said,
turning to leave the room again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, indeed, I never want anything.
I ain't by no means so bad off as is give
out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guessed as much. You can make a
fresh start now, and we shan't remind you
of the past.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, then I'm coming to the table,&quot; exclaimed
Mrs. Croft, &quot;and I'm going to be
helped like a Christian and feed myself
like a human being. This being put to bed
and just all but tied there with a rope isn't
going to go on much longer, I can tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't speak of it at all,&quot; said Jane;
&quot;you just do what you please here, and
we'll let you. I'm going to get you your
supper now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stop!&quot; cried old Mrs. Croft sharply.
&quot;Stop! I won't have it! I won't stand
it. Oh, I've had such a time,&quot; she went
on, bringing her clenched fist down vigorously
on her knee under the bedclothes
and raising her voice very high indeed,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;152]</span>
&quot;such a time! I had a beautiful son that
you or any girl might have been proud to
marry, and then he must go and marry that
Katie Croft creature. There ain't many
things to cut a mother's heart to the quick
like seeing her own son marry her own
daughter-in-law. Such a nice raised boy
as he was, so neat, and she kicking her
clothes under the bed at night to tidy up
the room. Oh!&quot; cried Mrs. Croft, lifting
her voice to a still more surprising pitch,
&quot;what I have suffered! Nothing ain't been
spared me. I lost my son and the use of
my legs from the shock and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Supper is all ready,&quot; Jane interrupted
sweetly and calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What you got?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sardines&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never eat 'em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Toast.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hate it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Plum preserves.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lord have mercy on me, I wouldn't
swallow one if you gave it to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;153]</span>
Jane stood still at the door.</p>

<p class="indent">Susan, having heard the screams, came
running in.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Mrs. Ralston,&quot; cried Mrs. Croft,
&quot;I had&quot;&mdash;Jane rose, approached the bed,
and laid a firm hand on her arm. &quot;What
do you want for supper?&quot; she asked in a
quiet, penetrating tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't want nothing,&quot; cried Mrs.
Croft; &quot;days I eat and days I don't.
This is a day I don't eat, and on such a day
I only take a little ham and eggs from time
to time. Oh, my husband, how I did love
you! It's just come over me how I loved
him, and I love him so I can't hardly stand
it&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We'll go out and have supper ourselves,
then,&quot; said Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Eat, drink, and be merry while you can,&quot;
fairly yelled Mrs. Croft. &quot;The handwriting
is on the wall and the Medes and Persians
is in the chicken yard right now. Oh,
what a&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They slipped out and shut the door after
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;154]</span>
them. Susan turned a scared face Jane's
way. &quot;Why, she's crazy!&quot; she said.
&quot;Katie always said so, and folks thought
she was just talking. It's awful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She's a little excited with the change,&quot;
said Jane soothingly; &quot;she'll be calmer
soon. It's very bad to shut one's self off
from others. It's better to fuss along
with disagreeable people than to live altogether
alone. She's grown flighty through
being left alone. It's a wonder that you
didn't get odd yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When they went back after supper, Mrs.
Croft was sound asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't wake her, for goodness' sake,&quot;
whispered Susan, in the doorway. Jane
left the room quietly, and her aunt took
her by the arm and led her up-stairs.
&quot;This is pretty serious,&quot; she said. &quot;I
think Katie Croft ought to have told us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She didn't want her to come; we insisted,&quot;
said Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tell you what,&quot; said Susan, &quot;we were
too happy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;155]</span>
Susan's tone was so solemn that Jane
had an odd little qualm. But the next
instant she knew that all was right, because
all is always right. &quot;Auntie,&quot; she said,
putting her hand on the older woman's
shoulder, &quot;you must try to realize that
you've moved out of the world where things
go wrong into the world where things go
right. When you go out of the cold, dark
winter night into a cosy, warm house, you
don't fear that the house will turn dark
and cold any minute.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But old Mrs. Croft isn't a house; she's
moved into us, instead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane smiled her customary smile of
tranquil sweetness. &quot;She has come to
show us ourselves,&quot; she said, &quot;and to bring
us to some kind of better things. I know
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan's eyes altered to confidence.
&quot;Well, Sunshine Jane,&quot; she said, &quot;I'll try
to believe that you know. I'll try.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They went to bed early, and Jane slept
on the dining-room sofa. In the night
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;156]</span>
Mrs. Croft, calling, woke her. She jumped
up and went to her at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm hungry. You didn't ask me here
to starve me, did you? Oh, how hungry
I am. I've never been so hungry before.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll get you anything you like,&quot; the girl
said. &quot;What shall it be?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Croft shook her head lugubriously.
&quot;Whatever I eat is sure to kill me. I wish
I was home. You don't know how good
dear Katie is to me, Miss Grey. Nobody
could, unless they lived with her year in
and year out as I do. Something told me
never to leave my sweet child, and I disobeyed
my conscience which won't let me
sleep for aching like a serpent's tooth. Oh,
my little Katie, my pretty little Katie, my
loving little Katie that I went and left at
home! Take me to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But she isn't at home,&quot; said Jane.
&quot;She's gone away on a little visit. She
went last evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall never see her again,&quot; said Mrs.
Croft mournfully. &quot;I shall never see no
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;157]</span>
one again. Oh, dear; oh, dear. My eyes.
My eyes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What shall I get you? A glass of
milk?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn't matter. Whatever you like.
I was never one to make trouble. Whatever
you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When Jane returned with the milk and
some hastily prepared bread and butter,
Mrs. Croft was praying rapidly. &quot;I think
I've got religion,&quot; said she, in a bright,
chatty tone; &quot;if you'll sit down, I'll convert
you. It's never too late to mend,
and so get your darning basket and come
right here.&quot; She began to eat and drink
very rapidly. &quot;It's going to kill me,&quot; she
said, between bites, &quot;but I don't care a
mite. What is life after all,&mdash;a vain
fleeting shadow of vanity,&mdash;why, you
ain't put no jam on this bread!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you like jam? I'll get you some at
once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, merciful heavens, waking me up
in the dead of night to give me plain bread
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;158]</span>
and no jam! I shall never see Katie again,
and perhaps it's just as well, for she'd not
stand such doings. Oh, you idle, thriftless
girl, take me home, take me home at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In the morning,&quot; said Jane gently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my,&mdash;why did I ever come!
Katie, my Katie, my long-loving Katie;
my dear little Katie that's gone to New
York!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then, having swallowed the milk in
great gulps and the bread in great bites,
she shut her eyes and lay back again in bed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shan't I bring you anything else?&quot;
Jane asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said the invalid, &quot;not by no means,
and I'll trouble you to get out and keep
out and don't make a noise in the morning,
for I want my last hours to be peaceful,
and I'm going to take a screw-driver and
fix my thoughts firmly to heaven at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane went softly out.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;159]</span></p>

<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="h2a">SHE SLEEPS</p>

<p class="indent">THE next morning Susan felt perturbed.
&quot;She'll take up a whole week of our
happy visit, and I can't bear to lose a
minute. The time's going too fast, anyhow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo Rath came in shortly after.
He and Madeleine and Emily Mead were
in and out daily to suit themselves by this
time. &quot;Do you know, Mrs. Croft has
gone off, nobody knows where,&quot; he said
gravely; &quot;she's left no address, and people
say she'll never come back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan threw up her hands with a wail.
&quot;Oh, Jane, she <i>has</i> left that dreadful old
woman on us for life; I'll just bet anything
folks knew exactly that she meant to do it
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;160]</span>
when they talked to me so. What <i>will</i>
Matilda say when she comes back?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane was silent a minute. &quot;It's no use
doubting what one really believes,&quot; she
said finally. &quot;I do really believe that I
came here for a good purpose, and I know
that I had a good purpose in inviting Mrs.
Croft. I'm taught that to doubt is like
pouring ink into the pure water of one's
good intentions, and I won't doubt. I
refuse to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if you go back to where you come
from and leave me with Matilda and old
Mrs. Croft, I'll be dead or I'll wish I was
dead,&mdash;it all comes to the same thing,&quot;
cried poor Susan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Auntie,&quot; said Jane firmly, &quot;I shan't
leave you alone with Aunt Matilda and
Mrs. Croft, you needn't fear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh,&quot; said Susan, her face undergoing a
lightning transformation, &quot;if you'll stay
here, I'll keep Mrs. Croft or anybody else,
with pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What, even me?&quot; laughed Lorenzo.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;161]</span>
&quot;I'd like to keep you,&quot; said Susan
warmly. &quot;I think you're one of the nicest
young men I ever knew.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'd like to stay,&quot; said Lorenzo, looking
at Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">She lifted up her eyes and they had a
peculiar expression.</p>

<p class="indent">Just then Emily Mead came in. &quot;Only
think,&quot; she said, directly greetings were
over, &quot;people say Mrs. Croft drew all
their money out of the bank before she left.
Everybody says she's deserted her mother-in-law
completely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jane, it really is so,&quot; said Susan; &quot;she
really is gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane looked steadily into their three
faces. &quot;If I begin worrying and doubting,
of course there'll be a chance to worry and
trouble, because I'm the strongest of you
all,&quot; she said gravely, &quot;but I won't go
down and live in the world of worry and
trouble under any circumstances. I know
that only good can come of Mrs. Croft's
being here. I <i>know</i> it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;162]</span>
&quot;I wish that I could learn how you
manage such faith,&quot; said the young artist.
&quot;I'd try it on myself,&mdash;yes, I would, for
a fact.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's not so easy,&quot; said Jane, looking
earnestly at him. &quot;It means just the
same mental discipline that physical culture
means for the muscles. It takes
time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I'd like to learn,&quot; said Lorenzo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So would I!&quot; said Emily Mead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've begun already,&quot; said Susan;
&quot;every time I think of old Mrs. Croft I
say: 'She's here for some good purpose,
God help us.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me,&quot; said Emily Mead, &quot;what
possessed you to have her, anyway?
Everybody's wondering.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jane thought that it would be a nice
thing to do. And so we did it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you always do things if you think
of them?&quot; Emily asked Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm taught that I must.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Taught?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;163]</span>
&quot;It's part of my sunshine work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's why she's here,&quot; interposed
Susan; &quot;she thought of me and came right
along.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily looked thoughtful. &quot;I wonder if
I could learn,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anybody can learn anything,&quot; said
Lorenzo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wouldn't it be nice to all learn Jane's
religion?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've got it most learned,&quot; said Susan,
&quot;I'm to where I'm most ready to stand
Matilda, if only we don't have to keep old
Mrs. Croft.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is old Mrs. Croft doing now?&quot;
Emily asked suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She's still asleep. She says that she
sleeps late.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Emily rose to go. Lorenzo Rath
rose and left with her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jane,&quot; said Susan solemnly, after they
were alone, &quot;I'm afraid that religion of
yours ain't as practical as it might be, after
all. It's got us old Mrs. Croft, and I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;164]</span>
ain't saying a word, but now I'm about
positive it's going to lose you that young
man. You could have him if you'd just
exert yourself a little, and you don't at
all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn't have him, Auntie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, you could. Don't tell me. I
know a young man when I see one, and Mr.
Rath's a real young man. He loves you,
Jane, just because nobody could help it,
and if you weren't always so busy, he'd
get on a good deal faster.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't marry, Aunt Susan.&quot; Jane,
with Madeleine's secret high in her heart,
was very busy setting the kitchen to rights.
&quot;Some people are not meant to have homes
of their own. It's the century.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fiddle for the century,&quot; said Susan,
with something almost like violence. &quot;I'm
awful tired of all this hash and talk about
the century. About the only thing I've
had to think of since Matilda made up her
mind I was too sick to get up, was what I
read in newspapers about the troubles of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;165]</span>
the century. Centuries is always in hot
water till they're well over, and then they
get to be called the good old days. I guess
days ain't so different nor centuries either
nor women neither. Fiddle for all this
kind of rubbish,&mdash;it's no use except to
upset a nice girl like you and keep her from
marrying a nice young fellow like Mr. Rath.
Girls don't know nothing about love no
more. Mercy on us, why, it's a kind of
thing that makes you willing to go right
out and hack down trees for the man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane looked a little smiling and a little
wistful. &quot;I'll tell you what it is, Auntie,&quot;
she said; &quot;when my father died he left a
debt that ought to be paid, and I promised
him I'd pay it. I couldn't marry&mdash;it
wouldn't be honest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan's eyes flew pitifully open. &quot;Good
heavens, mercy on us, no; then you never
can't marry, sure and certain. There never
was the man yet so good he wouldn't throw
a thing like that in a woman's teeth. It's
a man's way, my dear, and a wife ought not
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;166]</span>
to mind, but one of the difficulties of being
a wife is that you always do mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that I should mind,&quot; said Jane
quietly, &quot;and, anyway, I don't want to
marry. I'm much happier going about on
my sunbeam mission, trying to help others
a bit here and a bit there.&quot; She smiled
bravely as she spoke, for all that it takes a
deal of training in truth not to waver or
quaver in such a minute. She had to think
steadily along the lines which she had
worked so hard to build into every brain-cell
and spirit-fiber of her make-up.
&quot;Auntie,&quot; she went on then, after a brief
reflection that he who works in truth's wool
works without fear as to the breaking of
one single thread, &quot;you and I are trying
dreadfully hard&mdash;trying with all our might
to do exactly right. We're trying to break
your chains by the only way in which
material chains can be broken,&mdash;by breaking
those of others. We can't go astray.
If old Mrs. Croft should stay here till she
died, and if I should work till I died at
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;167]</span>
paying the debts of others, she'd stay for
some good purpose, and I'd be working in
the same way. Be very sure of that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">For a second Susan looked cheered&mdash;but
only for a second. Then, &quot;That's all very
well for you and me, who want to be uplifted&mdash;at
least you want to be, and I
think maybe I'll like it after I get a little
used to it. But Matilda doesn't know or
care anything about planes, and it's Matilda
I keep thinking of.&quot; There was another
pause, and then she added: &quot;And it's
Matilda I'll have to live with,&mdash;along
with old Mrs. Croft. Oh, Jane, I'd be so
much happier if you'd marry Mr. Rath and
let me come and live with you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane went and put her arms about her.
&quot;Auntie, it isn't easy to learn my way of
looking at things, because you have to keep
at them till they're so firm in you that
nothing from outside can ever shake or uproot
them. But what I believe is just so
firm with me, and I won't give anything up,&mdash;not
even about Mrs. Croft. We're all
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;168]</span>
right and she's all right and everything's
all right, and I don't need to marry any
one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan winked mournfully. &quot;If there
was only some way to meet Matilda on her
way home and kind of get that through her
head before she saw Mrs. Croft. You see,
she always shuts that room up cold winters
and keeps cold meat in there. I've had
many a good meal out of that room.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must not cast about for ways and
means,&quot; said Jane firmly. &quot;Life is like a
sunshiny warm day, and our part is to
breathe and feel and thank God,&mdash;not to
look for the sun to surely cease shining.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it does stop,&quot; wailed Susan, &quot;often.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, thank Heaven,&quot; said Jane, &quot;if it
didn't, we'd be burnt up alive by our own
vitality.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; said Susan briefly, &quot;you've
an answer for everything. Well, let's get
dinner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They went into the kitchen.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;169]</span></p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="h2a">EMILY'S PROJECT</p>

<p class="indent">AFTER dinner that day Emily Mead
came with her work. Emily Mead
was one of those nondescript girls who seem
to spring up more and more thickly in these
troublous, churned-up times of ours.</p>

<p class="indent">Too pretty to be plain, too unattractive
to be beautiful. Too well-to-do to need
to work, too poor to attain to anything for
which she longed. Too clever to belong to
her class, not clever enough to rise above it.
Altogether a very fit subject for Jane to
&quot;sunshine,&quot; as her aunt put it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you get along with old Mrs.
Croft?&quot; she asked, directly she was seated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She's asleep yet,&quot; Jane said; &quot;she
was so restless all night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;170]</span>
&quot;She always sleeps days and is awake all
night; didn't you know that before?&quot;
queried Emily, in surprise. &quot;Some one
ought to have told you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It doesn't matter,&quot; said Jane serenely.
There was never any bravado in her serenity;
it was quite sincere.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was what made Katie so mad,&quot;
Emily continued. &quot;She said it gave her
her days, to be sure, but, as she couldn't
very well sleep, too, all day, she never really
had any time herself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We'll get along all right,&quot; said Jane
quietly; &quot;old people have ways, and then
they change and have other ways, and the
rest must expect to be considerate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mercy on us, I wonder what she'll
change to next,&quot; said Susan, with feeling.
She had just returned from listening at the
invalid's door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't worry, Auntie,&mdash;just remember!&quot;
Jane's smile was at once bright
and also a bit admonitory.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm trying to believe that everything's
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;171]</span>
all right always, too,&quot; said Susan to Emily,
&quot;but, oh, my!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They went out on the shady side of the
house to where a little table stood, which
was made out of a board nailed into a cut-off
tree stump. Jane and Emily carried
chairs, and Susan brought her darning
basket. It was delightfully pleasant.
From time to time Jane or her aunt slipped
in and listened at the door, but old Mrs.
Croft slept on like a baby.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do wonder if Katie Croft has really
gone for good!&quot; Emily said to Susan, while
Jane was absent on one of these errands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't trust myself even with my own
opinions,&quot; said Susan reservedly; &quot;I haven't
much time to get changed before Matilda
comes, you know, and I want to believe in
Jane's religion if I can. It's so kind of
warm and comforting. I like it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jane,&quot; Emily said, turning towards her
when she returned, &quot;I've come to-day on an
awfully serious errand, and I want you to
help me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;172]</span>
&quot;I will certainly, if I can. What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you really believe that wanting
anything shows that one is going to get it?
You said something like that the other day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know that one can get anything one
wants,&quot; Jane answered gravely; &quot;of course
the responsibility of some kinds of wanting
is awfully heavy. But the law doesn't
alter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you explain it to me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that's it,&quot; said Susan, &quot;you tell
us how to manage. I want to get something
myself. Or I mean it's that I want something
I've got to go away again. Or I
guess I'd better not try to say what I
mean.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you won't either of you understand
what I mean, when I tell you,&quot; said Jane.
&quot;It's just as I said before, it takes a lot of
study to get your brain-cells to where they
can hold an idea that's really new to you.
Heads are like empty beehives,&mdash;you have
to have the comb before you can have the
honey, and every different kind of study
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;173]</span>
requires a different kind of cells just for
its use alone. When things don't interest
us, it's because the brain-cells in regard to
that subject have never been developed.
That's all. That's what they taught
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it's interesting,&quot; said Susan.
&quot;I always thought that the inside of my
head was one thing that I didn't need to
bother about. Seems it isn't, after all.
Go on, you Sunshine Jane, you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm like your aunt. I thought that
what I thought was the last thing that
mattered,&quot; said Emily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everything matters. There's nothing
in this world that doesn't matter, because
this world is all matter. Anything that
doesn't matter must be spirit. Don't you
see that when you say and really mean that
a thing doesn't matter, you mean that to
you it isn't material,&mdash;that it's no part of
your world?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me, I never thought of that,&quot; said
Susan, &quot;then I suppose as long as things do
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;174]</span>
matter to us, it means we just hang on
to them and hold them for all we're
worth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Jane, thoughts can't matter much?
Or we can forget things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There isn't anything that we can think
of at all that we are ever free not to think
about again&mdash;that is, if it's a good
thought,&quot; said Jane. &quot;If a thought comes
to us at all, it comes with some responsibility
attached. Either we are meant to gain
strength by dismissing it, if it seems wrong,
or it's our duty to do something with it, if
it's right. Most people's minds are all
littered up with thoughts that they never
either use or put away. That's what makes
them so stupid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Goodness!&quot; exclaimed Susan. &quot;Why,
I never put a thought away in my life,&mdash;not
as I know of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've never thought anything at all about
my thoughts,&quot; said Emily, looking rather
startled.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;175]</span>
&quot;Lots of people don't,&quot; said Jane; &quot;they
act just as a woman would in making a
dress, if she cut it out a bit now and a bit
then without ever laying the pattern back
even, and then joined it anywhere any time,
and then was surprised when it didn't even
prove fit to wear&mdash;not to speak of looking
all witched.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is that what ails some lives?&quot; Emily
asked, looking yet more startled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's what ails almost every life. It's
what makes 'I didn't think' the worst confession
in the world. A man driving a
motor with his eyes shut wouldn't be a bit
worse. Life's a great powerful force always
rushing on, and we swing into the tide and
never bother to row or to steer or to see that
our boat is water-tight.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You make me feel awful, Jane. As if
I'd been lazy, staying in bed so. And it
was the only way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You couldn't do any better, Auntie.
At least you weren't doing anything wrong.
Being moored in a little, quiet cove is better
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;176]</span>
than being adrift and slamming into the
boats of others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'd really have had to think more about
Matilda's thoughts than my own, if I'd
known. I'd never have had time for much
thinking as I pleased in the way you say; I
was always jumping up and flopping down.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jane,&quot; said Emily earnestly, &quot;then
every thought matters?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, or matterates.&quot; Jane smiled. &quot;If
a thought doesn't produce good, it'll surely
produce bad,&mdash;it's got to do something.
You plant your thoughts in time just as one
plants seed in the ground, and any further
thoughts of the same kind add to its strength
until enough strength causes an appearance
in this world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You really believe that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it. I know it so well that I
think that every seed that's ever fallen was
a lesson that we were too stupid to learn.
Every time a seed fell and germinated, God
said: 'There, that's the very plainest teaching
on earth. Can't you see?' Sometimes
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;177]</span>
I think the world's all a book for us
to learn heaven in, just as our bodies explain
our souls to us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan looked at Emily in an awed way.
&quot;I guess I can get to believe it all,&quot; she
said, in a low tone; &quot;it sounds so plain
when you stop and think of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll try to believe it,&quot; said Emily, &quot;but
what I care most about is to learn how to
get what you want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane considered. &quot;That comes ever so
far along. You have to learn to get what
you want out of yourself before you can be
upon the plane where you naturally get
what you want, because you are too far on
to want what you couldn't get.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily didn't understand and didn't care.
&quot;Do tell me how it's done, anyway,&quot; she
begged eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know whether what I say will
have any meaning for you, but I'll say it,
anyway. You'll have to know that it's
what I believe and live by, and if you're to
believe it and live by it, it will come to you
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;178]</span>
quite easily, and if not it's because it isn't
for you yet.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean to believe,&quot; said Emily firmly.
&quot;I want something, and I'll do anything to
get it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane shook her head. &quot;That's the very
hardest road to come by,&quot; she said, &quot;unless
it's some overcoming in yourself that you
are wanting. You see, the very first step
has to be the conquering of ourselves, not
the asking for material things. You have
to open a channel for the spirit, and then
the material flows through afterwards, as a
matter of course. But if you've gone on a
good ways, you don't think of getting <i>things</i>
at all; you just want opportunities to grow,
and you know that what you need for life
will keep coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it doesn't with lots of people,&quot; said
Emily. &quot;Just look at the poor&mdash;and the
suffering.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They aren't living according to this
law,&quot; said Jane. &quot;They're living on
another plane. There are different planes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;179]</span>
&quot;Don't you see,&quot; interposed Susan, &quot;we
asked Mrs. Croft because it would get me
on a plane where, when Matilda came back,
she wouldn't mind so many changes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily looked inquiring. &quot;A different
plane?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jane, &quot;you can lift yourself
straight out of any circle of conditions by
suddenly altering all your own ideas&mdash;if
you've strength to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'd never have asked Mrs. Croft alone
by myself, you know,&quot; said Susan; &quot;nobody
that looked at things the way other
folks do, would. But Jane looks at everything
different from everybody else. She
said it would be a quick way of being different.
I guess she's right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never heard any ideas like that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But they aren't new,&quot; said Jane;
&quot;they're older than the hills. God made
the world and then gave every man dominion
over his world. We all have the whole
of <i>our</i> world to rule. This way of looking
at things is new to you, but there are
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;180]</span>
thousands and thousands of people proving
it true every day. All the old religions
teach it, and all the new religions bid you
live it or they won't be for you. They
don't kill men for not believing now. They
just let them live and suffer and go blundering
on. Why&quot;&mdash;Jane grew suddenly pink
with fervor&mdash;&quot;why, everywhere I look, almost,
I see just lovely chances being let die,
because people won't fuss to tend them.
People are too careless and too thoughtless.
The truth is so plain that the very word
'thoughtless' fairly screams what's the matter
to every one, but hardly any one bothers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But the people who believe as you do,&mdash;do
they all get everything that they
want?&quot; asked Emily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Or else they want what they get,&quot; said
Jane; &quot;it comes to exactly the same thing
when you begin to understand. The beauty
of every step nearer God is the new learning
of how exactly right his world is managed.
All my old puzzles have been cleared up,
and it's so wonderful. Why, I used to
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;181]</span>
think that when beautiful, dear little children
died it was awful; but now I know
that they came to help and teach others,
and that when they'd spread their lesson to
those others, they didn't need lessons themselves
and just left the school and went
back into the beautiful world of Better
Things. It was such a help to me to know
why splendid men and women who were
needed went so suddenly sometimes; it's
because they're needed much more elsewhere
and respond to that call of duty at
once. I don't think of death as anything
dreadful now; I think of it as a door that
will open and close very easily for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's one door that Matilda liked to keep
setting open,&quot; said Susan,&mdash;&quot;oh, dear me,
Jane, I'm trying to grow brain-cells and be
a credit to you, and I can't think of anything
but old Mrs. Croft. Perhaps she's
woke up.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane rose and went into the house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think you can take it all in?&quot;
Emily asked, slowly and thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;182]</span>
&quot;I'm doing my best,&quot; said Susan, &quot;she's
so happy and so good I think she must know
what she's talking about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane came back. &quot;She's still sleeping,&quot;
she said; &quot;don't you worry, dear Auntie.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't help it,&quot; said Susan. &quot;I've
dodged about for so long and played things
were so that weren't so, that I guess I'm
pretty much out of tune, and it'll be a little
while before I can stop worrying.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, you aren't out of tune,&quot; said Jane,
smiling at her affectionately, &quot;or if you are,
just say you're in tune and you will be,
right off.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you believe that?&quot; Emily asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, of course. I know it absolutely
for myself, and I know that it's equally true
for others if they have the strength to
declare it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But how?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How! Why, because every declaration
of good is spiritual, and proves that you
are one with your soul and master over your
body, just as false declarations make you
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;183]</span>
one with your body and take away all power
from your soul. That's how mental cures
work. When anybody says 'I am well,'
she declares souls can't be ill, and she makes
Truth stronger by adding her strength to its
strength. But when a man says 'I am ill,'
he declares a lie, for souls can't be ill, and
so he's claiming not to be spiritual, but just
to be his own body. It's as if a weaver
stopped weaving and said: 'I've broken
several threads, and <i>I'm</i> going to be imperfect,
and <i>I</i> won't bring any price, and
<i>I'll</i> only be fit to cut up into cleaning
cloths.' What would you think of him?
You'd say: 'Why, that's only an hour's work
in cloth and can be put aside without further
thought. Just go right on and with your
skill and judgment make the next piece
perfect. It was never any of it <i>you</i>; it
was the stuff you were making.' Bodies
are the stuff we are making.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily laid down her work. &quot;Jane, that's
wonderful,&quot; she said solemnly. &quot;You put
that so that I really got hold of it. I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;184]</span>
understand exactly what you mean, and if
only everybody else did!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But nobody else really matters to you,&quot;
said Jane; &quot;all that matters to you is that
you believe. They have their lives&mdash;you
have yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily was looking very earnest. &quot;I'm
going to try,&quot; she said, rising. &quot;I'm going
to try. I must go now, but I'm going
home to go to work in my world.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane walked with her to the gate. &quot;I'll
help you all I can,&quot; she said, &quot;I'm so glad
you're interested. It makes life so splendid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily stopped and took her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jane,&quot; she said, &quot;I want to tell you
something. I want to marry Mr. Rath.
I think he's the nicest man I ever saw.
Do you really&mdash;really&mdash;believe that I
can, if I learn to think as you do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane turned white beneath the other's
eyes. &quot;Why, but don't you know&mdash;don't
you <i>see</i> that he's in love?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In love! With you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;185]</span>
&quot;With me,&mdash;oh, <i>no</i>. With Madeleine.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no, he's not in love with her,&quot; said
Emily decidedly; &quot;I know that. I know
that perfectly well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They knew one another before they
came here, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, I see them round town together
all hours,&quot; said Emily; &quot;they're like
brother and sister, they're not one bit in
love. I thought that perhaps it was you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear, no&mdash;I can't marry. I never
even think of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't you use any of your ideas with
him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, indeed! I never ask anything for
myself any more. I just ask to manifest
God's will,&mdash;to help in any of His work
that offers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're awfully good, dear. But, honestly,
do you think that I could surely get
him if I tried?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, the law is certain, but&quot;&mdash;Jane
spoke gently&mdash;&quot;you're so far from
understanding it yet. I only told you a little.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;186]</span>
It takes ever so long to get one's mind built
to where it will grasp an ideal and hold it
without wavering once. There's such a lot
I didn't tell you; I couldn't in those few
minutes. I just showed you the picture,
and you have to work hard till you learn
how to paint it. You see, a wish is like
blowing a bubble, and if you add wishes
and more wishes, you gradually change the
bubble into a solid mold, which is a real
thing of spirit but empty of material; then,
if you keep it solid and firm, the fact of it
is real spiritually, and a vacuum as to matter
makes the matter just <i>have</i> to fill it, and it is
that filling into the mold shaped by our
thoughts that makes what we see and live
here in this world. The world is all matter
circulating in thought-molds. Anything
that you carefully and steadily and consistently
think out must become manifest.
God manifesting His will means that. We
are His will. And the nearer we approximate
to the highest in Him, the more we
can manifest ourselves. That's why very
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;187]</span>
good people are seldom rich; they want to
manifest in deeds and not in things. That's
why they never keep money&mdash;it only represents
to them the need of others. If you
really and truly love Mr. Rath, and feel it
steadily and steadfastly your mission to
make him very happy, of course it will be,
even though he loved some one else. But to
want a man who loved some one else
wouldn't be possible to any one who believed
in this teaching. That's where it is,
you see. When you get power, you never
want to do evil with it. Power from God
never manifests in evil. When you are
where you can get whatever you want, it
simply means that you are living where only
good can come, and where you are able to
see it coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily stood perfectly still, looking downwards.
Then suddenly she burst into
violent sobs. &quot;Oh, I feel so small, so mean&mdash;so
wicked. It isn't as you feel a bit with
me. I just want to get out of this stupid
town&mdash;and he's so good-looking!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;188]</span>
Jane's eyelids fell.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I feel so mean and petty,&quot; Emily went
on, pressing her hands over her face. &quot;I
could never be good like you. I can't
understand. I just want to be married.
I'm so tired of my life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said Jane, with steady firmness,
&quot;why don't you go to him and talk it all
over nicely? As you would with Madeleine
or me. Perhaps that would be best.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you really think so?&quot; said Emily,
lifting her eyes; &quot;do you believe that a
girl can go to a man and be honest with
him, just as a man can with a woman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn't,&quot; said Jane, &quot;because I
wouldn't want to, but if you want to do it,
I don't see why you can't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why wouldn't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I get my things that other way,&mdash;simply
by asking God to guide me towards
His will and guide me from mistake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you do that about asking old Mrs.
Croft?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;189]</span>
&quot;Certainly. I do it about everything.
I live by that rule now. I've absolute faith
in God's guidance.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily looked at her. &quot;It must be beautiful,&quot;
she said, &quot;and you really think that
it would be all right for me to go and talk
to him, do you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said Jane slowly. &quot;I think that
it would be best all round.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;After all, this is the woman's century,&quot;
said Emily, with a sudden energy quite unlike
her previous interest. &quot;I don't know
why I shouldn't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think that the best way to handle all
our problems is to let them flow naturally
to their finish,&quot; said Jane; &quot;dammed or
choked rivers always make trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should like to say just what I felt to a
man just once,&quot; said Emily thoughtfully.
&quot;It would do me a world of good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then say it,&quot; said Jane. &quot;Only are
you really sure that he's not in love with
Madeleine?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I'm positive as to that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;190]</span>
&quot;Then go ahead.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They parted, and Jane returned to the
house. She was not so entirely spiritual
that she could repress a very human kind of
smile over Emily's project.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;191]</span></p>

<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="h2a">EMILY IS HERSELF FREELY</p>

<p class="indent">AS Emily turned from Mrs. Ralston's
gate, she felt more buoyant happiness
than anything in life had ever hitherto
brought her. She felt licensed on high
authority to revel in the hitherto forbidden.
She wanted Lorenzo Rath, and she thought
that she understood how to get him. We
may follow her thought and then we will
follow where it led her, for in all the surge
of the new teaching there is no lesson greater
to learn than this which Emily had failed
to grasp,&mdash;that the possession of tools does
not make one a carver; that all things
spiritual must be learned exactly as all
things material. One may have so lived
previously that the learning is a mere showing
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;192]</span>
how, but without experience nothing,
either spiritual, mental, or physical, can be
efficaciously handled. When people declare
that something is not true because
they tried it and it failed to work, remember
Emily Mead. Emily had acquired just
one idea out of Jane's exposition: &quot;That
you could get anything that you want.&quot;
It is the idea that hosts of people find most
attractive in this world, quite irrespective
of its correlative esotericism,&mdash;that the
soul growing towards infinite power learns
every upward step by resolutely liking what
it gets. No man can climb a stair by hacking
down every step passed; he climbs by
being so firm upon each step that he can
poise his whole weight thereon as he mounts.
It is part of the supremely beautiful logic
of the highest teaching that the same effort
which Jesus made&mdash;every great teacher
has made&mdash;is sure to make, too. We
must see the Divine embodied in the
Present and the Weak and the Humble,
before in our own spirit we may deal, for
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;193]</span>
the good of all, with the Future and
Strength and Power. When one seizes
upon anything God-given as a means of acquiring
earth-gifts, one has but seized the
empty air; the idea and then ideal have
never been in the possession of such an one.
There is nothing shut away from those who
really make God's teaching a vital part of
themselves, but such men and women are
no longer keen to selfishly possess, and the
good which they reach out for flows easily
in for their further distribution; in other
words, they become what we were all designed
to be,&mdash;the outward manifestations
of God's purpose, the living breathing,
blessed servants of His will.</p>

<p class="indent">How far this interpretation lay from poor
Emily's comprehension the reader knows.</p>

<p class="indent">She hurried along, her whole being bounding
with joy over the simplicity of the new
lesson. It all seemed almost too story-book-like
to be happening in her stupid,
commonplace life. She had spent so many
long hours in thinking over how things
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;194]</span>
would never happen for her, that she had
entirely lost faith in their ever changing
their ways and now, all of a sudden, here
was a complete reversal. Bonds were
turned into wings; that unattainable being,
a live man, was not only at hand, but available;
she felt herself bidden not to doubt
her power; she judged herself advised to
say frankly all the things that girls may
never say. This was the day of feminine
freedom. To wish was to have. What
one wanted was the thing that was best for
one. Emily&mdash;with all of Jane's ideas
swimming upside down in her head&mdash;felt
superbly joyous and confident. After all,
being alive was a pretty good thing.</p>

<p class="indent">She turned a corner into the lane that led
in a roundabout way to her mother's back
garden gate and walked swiftly. She was
a fine, straight girl with a lithe, springy walk.
Perhaps Lorenzo Rath could not have done
better, from most standpoints, than to
marry such an one. Many men do worse.
And there was old Mr. Cattermole's money,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;195]</span>
too. Some of these views float in all human
atmosphere to-day&mdash;float there securely,
because the world is a practical world, and
an automobile is obvious, while love and
trust are absolutely unknown to many.
&quot;Ye cannot serve God and Mammon too,&quot;
and Mammon is very plain and practical,
rolling on rubber tires to the best restaurant.
Emily could not have reduced her
roseate visions to any such sordid reasoning,
but love to her meant leaving town and
having a good-looking and lively young man
to take her about. This was not really
love, any more than the means by which
she expected to acquire it were the religion
taught by Jane. We hear much of the
downfall of love and the downfall of religion
in these days, but no one even stops to
realize that religion and love cannot possibly
even shake on their thrones. Their counterfeits
may crumble and tumble, but real
truth can never fail. It was the counterfeits
at which Emily, like many another,
grasped eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;196]</span>
So now she was tripping lightly along and,
turning the twist by the great chestnut tree,
her heart gave a sudden flop, for just ahead
she saw her quarry. He was propped
against the fence, using his knees for an
easel, while he made a rapid water-color
sketch. He was good at those little impressions
of an artistic bit, that nearly
always show forth in youth a great artist
struggling to grow.</p>

<p class="indent">Emily started, for she was very close to
him before she saw him, and her rampant
thoughts led her to blush, apologize, and
stammer precisely as she might have done,
had her sex never advanced at all but merely
remained the dominant note that they have
always been.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Mr. Rath,&quot; and then she paused.</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo&mdash;who wanted to finish his
sketch&mdash;nodded pleasantly without looking
up. &quot;Grand day for walking,&quot; he said,
as a supremely polite hint, and continued to
work rapidly.</p>

<p class="indent">Emily went close beside him and looked
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;197]</span>
downward upon the canvas. &quot;How pretty!
I wish I knew more about pictures. What
is that brown hill? You can't see a hill
from here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's a cow,&quot; said Lorenzo, painting
very fast indeed, &quot;but don't ask me to
explain things, for I can't work and talk at
the same time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily sank down beside him with a
pleasant sense of proprietorship now that
she could get him by will power alone.
&quot;I've just come from Mrs. Ralston's.
They're in such distress over old Mrs.
Croft.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is she worse?&quot; The artist forgot to
paint all of a sudden, and turned quickly
towards her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no,&mdash;she was asleep when I left.
Jane didn't seem a bit troubled, but Mrs.
Ralston is almost wild over not knowing
what to say to her sister when she comes
back and finds that awful old woman there.
It's a terrible situation. Everybody knows
that young Mrs. Croft has run away. She
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;198]</span>
just hated to stay and now she's gone.
Isn't it awful?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I don't know,&quot; said Lorenzo,
suddenly regaining his deep interest in work,
&quot;I have a distinct feeling that Miss Grey
will bring things out all right for most
people always. It's her way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, she's a dear girl,&quot; said Emily, and
paused to have time to consider things a
little while, feeling that the conversation
should be continued by the man. The man
didn't continue the conversation, however,
merely wielding his brush and looking completely
absorbed.</p>

<p class="indent">Then she remembered her mission. &quot;Mr.
Rath, do you believe in frankness always?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish that I did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But don't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Civilization wouldn't stand for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps not every one could bear it,
but some could. I could, I'm sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you so sure?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I am sure. I was talking with
Jane alone just at the gate before I left, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;199]</span>
she believes that frankness is best always.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's easiest, certainly.&quot; Lorenzo raised
his eyebrows a little impatiently, but she
paid no attention.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you think so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, of course. When one wants to be
let alone and blurts out, 'Let me alone,'
why, one gets let alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but that would be impolite,&quot; said
Emily, feeling that for an artist he used very
crude metaphor. &quot;Of course, Jane and I
were not talking about that kind of people,
or that kind of ways. We were talking of
people like you and me&mdash;nice people, you
know. Jane advised me to be quite frank
with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo opened his eyes widely. &quot;About
what, please?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, about all things. You see I meet so
few men, and men are so interesting, and I
enjoy talking with them. I've read a good
deal, and I don't care for the life in this
place. I want to leave it dreadfully.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;200]</span>
&quot;So do I,&quot; said the artist. &quot;I quite agree
with you there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, Jane has been teaching me to
understand life, and I am getting the feeling
that I am meant for something else than
just helping my mother, wandering about
town, and going to church. I'm very tired
and restless.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo painted fast.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Rath, if you&mdash;a man&mdash;felt as I
do, what would you do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Get out.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But where?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everybody can find a way, if they really
want to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn't as if I had talent, you see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A good many people haven't talent
and yet do very well, indeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I don't want to be a shop-girl or
anything like that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Naturally not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a pause.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm very much interested in the progress
women are making,&quot; said Emily. &quot;I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;201]</span>
read all I can get hold of about it. Don't
you think it remarkable?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't think much about it, and I skip
everything on the subject.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Mr. Rath!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm a jealous brute. I don't like to
realize that a woman can do everything
that is a man's work, even to the verge of
driving him to starvation, while he can't
do any of her work under any circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He could wash and cook and sweep.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, he's invented machines to save her
that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see you've no sympathy with the advanced
woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I have. I'm very sorry for her.
A nice mess the next generation will be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My one comfort is that boys take after
their mothers, and I'm looking to see a
future generation of men so strong-minded
that they smash ladies back to where they
belong&mdash;in the rear with the tents.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;202]</span>
&quot;Goodness, Mr. Rath, then you don't
like any of the ways things are going?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I don't. Once upon a time
a busy man's time was sacred; now any
woman who feels like taking it, appropriates
it mercilessly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should lock the door, if I felt that way.
But now really, don't you think that we
might speak quite openly and frankly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo began to put up his paints.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I want to get to the bottom of a lot of
things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're the first man that I've ever
known that I felt could understand what I
meant, and I do want to know the man's
side of things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A man hasn't got any side nowadays.
He's not allowed one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily looked a little surprised. &quot;You
speak bitterly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think I've a right. Men are still
observing the rules of the game and suffering
bitter consequences.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;203]</span>
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Women with homes have gone into the
world to earn some extra pocket money
until they've knocked the bottom out of
all wage systems, and you never can make
the wildest among them see that women
can't expect men's pay unless they do men's
work. A man's work is only half of it in
business, the other half is supporting a
family. Women want equal pay and to
spend the result as they please. The
man's wages go usually on bread and the
woman's on bonnets, to speak broadly.
He goes to his own home at night and has
every single bill for four to ten people.
She goes to somebody else's house and has
only her own needs to face, with perhaps
some contribution towards those off somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me,&quot; said Emily, &quot;I never thought
of that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Lorenzo, snapping the lid
of his color box shut, &quot;women don't think
of that. But men do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;204]</span>
&quot;But surely there are loads and loads of
women who do support families.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and who are dragged down by the
injustice of what economists call 'The Law
of Supplemented Earnings'!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Emily felt that the experience of conversing
frankly with a live man was not exactly
what she had anticipated. It certainly
was in no way romantic. She felt baffled
and a good deal chilled. The conversation
had taken a horrid twist away from what
she had intended.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You think that women have no right
to go out in the world then?&quot; she said.
&quot;You don't sympathize with the modern
trend?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I sympathize with nature and human
nature,&quot; said Lorenzo, &quot;but not with
civilization.&quot; He rose to his feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Mr. Rath!&quot; she looked upward,
expecting to be assisted to rise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe in life, lived by live things in
the way God meant. I loathe this modern
institution limping along with its burden of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;205]</span>
carefully fed and tended idiots and invalids
and babies, better dead. I wish that I
were a Zulu.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good Heavens!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come,&quot; said the man, picking up his
load, &quot;we can go now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Had you finished?&quot; She scrambled to
her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'd done all that I could under the
circumstances.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose the light changes so fast at
this time....&quot; Emily was quite unsuspicious
and content. The intuition that
used to reign supreme in women was especially
lacking in her. She had not the
least idea of what her presence meant to the
unhappy artist.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, come,&quot; he repeated impatiently.</p>

<p class="indent">They walked away then through the
pretty winding lane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems to me so awful that we are all
so hopeless,&quot; Emily went on presently.
&quot;We are all put here and often see just what
should be done and can't do it possibly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;206]</span>
&quot;I do exactly what I choose,&quot; said
Lorenzo,&mdash;then he added: &quot;as a usual
thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You must be very happy.&quot; She paused.
&quot;I suppose that you have plenty of money
to live as you please.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm fortunate enough not to have any.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Goodness!&quot; the exclamation was sincere.
The shock to Emily was dreadful.
&quot;Why do you call that fortunate?&quot; she
asked, after a little hasty agony of downfall
as to rich and generous travel, spaced
off by going to the theater.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because it makes me know that I shall
do something in the world. A very little
money is enough to swamp a man nowadays,
when the idea of later being supported by a
woman is always a possibility. Oh,&quot; said
Lorenzo, with sudden irritation, &quot;if there
weren't so many perfectly splendid women
and girls in the world, I'd go off and become
a Trappist. Everything's being knocked
into a cocked hat. I've had girls practically
make love to me. Disgusting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;207]</span>
Emily felt her heart hammer hard.
&quot;You're very old-fashioned in your views,&quot;
she said, a little faintly.</p>

<p class="indent">They came out by her mother's back
gate as she spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; said Lorenzo, &quot;I admit it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Mead came running out of the back
door. &quot;Oh, Emily,&quot; she cried, &quot;old Mrs.
Croft is dead. Jane sent for the doctor&mdash;she
sent a boy running&mdash;but she's
dead. Wherever have you been for so
long?&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;208]</span></p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="h2a">JANE'S CONVERTS</p>

<p class="indent">THE feelings which revolved around
the dead body of old Mrs. Croft can
be better imagined than described; everybody
had wondered as to every contingency
except this. In the midst of the confusion
Jane moved quietly, a little white and with
lips truly saddened. &quot;And I meant to do
such a lot for her,&mdash;I meant to help her so
much,&quot; she murmured from time to time.</p>

<p class="indent">The doctor, a ponderous gentleman of
great weight in all ways, was very grave.
The doctor said that he had warned the
daughter of such a possible ending twenty
years before. &quot;Heart failure was <i>always</i>
imminent,&quot; he declared severely, looking
upon Jane, Susan, and Mrs. Cowmull, who
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;209]</span>
had driven out with him and thus become
instantly a privileged person. &quot;She never
ought to have been left alone a minute during
these last forty years. Even if she had
lived to be a hundred, the danger was always
there. Such neglect is awful.&quot; He stopped
and shook his head vigorously. &quot;Awful,&quot;
he declared again with emphasis, &quot;awful!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn't know that she had heart
disease,&quot; said Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No blame attaches to you,&quot; said the
doctor, veering suddenly about as to the
point in discussion; &quot;nobody can blame
you. I shall exonerate you completely.
Of course, if you were not aware of the state
of the case, you couldn't be expected to consider
its vital necessities.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, and it was so vital,&quot; sobbed Mrs.
Cowmull. &quot;Dear, sweet, old Mrs. Croft.
Our sunbeam. And to go off like that.
What good is life when people can die any
minute. Oh! Oh!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a brief pause for silent sorrow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never looked for her to die,&quot; Mrs.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;210]</span>
Cowmull went on, shaking her head. &quot;I
always told Emily she'd outlive even
Brother Cattermole. So many people will,
you know. Dear, kind, loving friend!
And now to think she's gone. I can't make
it seem true. She's been alive so long.
Seems only yesterday that I was up to see
Katie about making a pie for the social,
and our dear, sweet friend was singing her
favorite song, <i>Captain Jinks of the Horse
Marines</i>, all the time. What spirits she
did have everywhere, except in her legs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan sat perfectly quiet. The doctor
took Jane's arm and led her into the hall,
there to speak of the first few necessary
steps to be taken. Then he returned to the
sitting-room, gathered up Mrs. Cowmull
and departed, saying that he would send
&quot;some practical person at once.&quot; Mrs.
Cowmull, who was widely known as having
practical designs on him, did not resent the
implied slur at her own abilities at all.</p>

<p class="indent">After they were gone, there was a slight
further pause, and then Susan rose slowly
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;211]</span>
and went and laid her hands upon her
niece's shoulders. &quot;Oh, Jane, that religion
of yours is a wonderful thing. I'm
converted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane started. &quot;Converted, Auntie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes. You were sure that it would come
out all right and now see.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then a little white smile had to cross the
young girl's face. &quot;The poor old woman,&quot;
she said gently, &quot;to think of her lying there
all alone all that day. I thought that she
was sleeping so quietly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, she was,&quot; said Susan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, of course she was. It's just our
little petty way of thinking that masks all
of what is truly sacred and splendid behind
a veil of wrong thinking. Of course she
was sleeping quietly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It'll be sort of awful if they can't find
Katie, though,&quot; Susan said next; &quot;she left
no address, and I think it's almost silly to
try to hunt her up. I'm only too pleased
to pay for the funeral, I'm sure, and there
won't be any real reason for her returning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;212]</span>
&quot;No,&quot; said Jane thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I really can look forward to
Matilda's coming back now,&quot; pursued
Susan. &quot;I shan't mind a bit. Old Mrs.
Croft has done that much good, anyway,&mdash;she's
made me feel that Matilda's coming
back is just nothing at all. You see you
knew that everything was coming out all
right, but I'd never had any experience
with that kind of doings up till now, and
it was all new to me. I was only thinking
of when you and me would have to face
Matilda. Matilda would have looked
pretty queer if she'd come home to old Mrs.
Croft to tend, and me up and lively.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane didn't seem to hear. &quot;I never once
thought of her dying,&quot; she said again; &quot;oh,
dear, she had so much to learn. I expected
to do her such a lot of good.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wouldn't complain, Jane. I wouldn't
find fault with a thing. Goodness, think
if she'd begun singing <i>Captain Jinks</i> last
night. I've heard that sometimes she'd
sing it six hours at a stretch.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;213]</span>
Jane shook her head. &quot;Who is to go
down and pack up that house?&quot; she
wondered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, the house can be rented furnished.
It's a nice home for anybody,&quot; said Susan,
&quot;and the rent'll buy her a lovely monument.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The funeral was fixed for the third day,
and some effort made to trace the daughter-in-law.
But that lady evidently didn't
care to be found.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's hardly any use going to a great deal
of expense to hunt her up,&quot; Lorenzo said
to Jane, &quot;because the house is all there is,
and a thorough search with detectives would
just about eat it up alive.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He probably was not wholly disinterested
in his outlook, for the next bit of news that
shook the community was that Lorenzo
Rath had taken Mrs. Croft's house and
moved in! Naturally Mrs. Cowmull was
far from pleased. &quot;Of course it means
he's going to get married,&quot; she said to Miss
Vane, &quot;but what folly to take a house so
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;214]</span>
soon. Who's to cook for him? And who's
he going to marry? Not Emily, I know.
She wouldn't have him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Vane didn't know and didn't care.
&quot;Not my Madeleine,&quot; she said promptly,
for her part; &quot;she gets a letter every day.
She'll marry that man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then it's Jane Grey,&quot; said Mrs. Cowmull.
The town was greatly exercised,
and not as positive as to Emily's state of
mind as her aunt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It'll be one of those two,&quot; Mrs. Ball said
to Miss Crining (both very superior women
and much given to meeting at the grocery
store). &quot;They're both after him. Emily
chases him wherever he's posing woods
and cows, and the little appetite that Mrs. Cowmull
says he has, after going to Mrs. Ralston's,
shows what they're thinking of.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Crining shook her head. &quot;Once
on a time girls were so sweet and womanly,&quot;
she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My,&quot; said Mrs. Ball, &quot;I remember
when my husband asked me. I almost
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;215]</span>
fell flat. I'd never so much as thought of
him. I was engaged to a boy named
Richie Kendall, and Mr. Ball was bald, and
had all those children older than I was.
There was some romance about life then.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And me,&quot; said Miss Crining, with a
gentle sigh, &quot;I never told a soul I was in
love till months after he was drowned. I
didn't know I was in love myself. Girls
used to be like that, modest, timid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Rath's very severe on girls nowadays,
Mrs. Cowmull says,&quot; said Mrs. Ball;
&quot;but he's blind like all men are and will get
hooked when he ain't looking, like they all
do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Lorenzo Rath didn't care about any
of the gossip; he was so happy over his
home. &quot;I'll have a woman come and cook
occasionally,&quot; he explained blithely to Jane
and Susan, &quot;and I'll get all my illustrating
off my hands in short order.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you illustrate?&quot; Jane asked.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that's my bread-and-butter job.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It'll be nice to have you in the neighborhood,&quot;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;216]</span>
said Susan placidly; &quot;to think
how it's all come about, too. I'm in heaven,
no matter what I'm doing. I just sit about
and pray to understand more of Jane's
religion. I'm gasping it down in big swallows.
I think it's so beautiful how she
does right, without having to take the
consequences.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane laughed a little at that and went out
to get supper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She's a nice girl,&quot; Lorenzo said, looking
after her; &quot;when she leaves here, what
shall we do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, heavens, I don't know,&quot; said
Susan. &quot;I try never to think of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And what is she going to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, she's going back to her nursing,
and I want to cry when I think that other
people will have her around and I shan't.
I'll be here alone with Matilda. Not but
what I'm a good deal more reconciled than
I was, when I thought I'd be alone with
Matilda and old Mrs. Croft, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that would have been bad,&quot; said
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;217]</span>
Lorenzo soberly. &quot;Well, I must be running
along. I've got a lot of work to do and a
lot of thinking, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan contemplated him earnestly.
&quot;Well,&quot; she said, with fervor, &quot;when Jane
goes, I'll still have you, anyway.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo, who had just risen, stopped
short at that. &quot;Do you know an idea that
I'm just beginning to hold?&quot; he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No; how should I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's this. Why shouldn't you and I try
working Jane's Rule of Life a little? I'm
dreadfully impressed with a lot she says.
Suppose you and I pulled together and made
up our minds that she was going to stay here
in some perfectly right and pleasant and
proper way. How, then? Don't you believe
maybe we could manage it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan stared. &quot;But there couldn't be
any perfectly right, pleasant, proper way,&quot;
she said sadly, &quot;because she wants to go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'd like to try.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The aunt shook her head, sighing heavily.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;218]</span>
&quot;It's no use. There isn't a way. Nothing
could keep her. You see, she's got some
family debts to pay, and she can't rest till
she's paid 'em. I've begged and prayed
her to stay; I've told her that her own flesh
and blood has first claim, but she won't
hear to any kind of sense.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish that we might try,&quot; Lorenzo
insisted. &quot;I've listened to her till I just
about believe she really does know what
she's talking about. It seems as if it's all
so logical and after all, it's the way God
made the world, surely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know, but you and I ain't equal
to making worlds and won't be yet awhile.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't care,&quot; said the young man, turning
towards the door, &quot;I'm going at it
alone, then. I don't believe that any one
in the world needs her as much as I do, and
I'm going to have her, and that by her own
methods, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan's mouth opened in widest amazement.
&quot;Mercy on us, you ain't proposing
to her by way of me, are you? You don't
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;219]</span>
mean that you really do want to marry her,
do you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I don't mean that I want to marry
her. I mean that I'm going to marry her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! Oh!&quot; the aunt cried faintly.
&quot;Oh, goodness me! But I don't know why
I'm surprised, for I said you was in love with
her right from the start. I couldn't see
how you could help but be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I couldn't help but be. Who
could? She's one of the few real girls that
are left in the world these days. The
regular girls with lectures and diplomas
and stiff collars have spoiled the sweetest
things God ever made. Men don't thank
Heaven for any of these late innovations
wrought in womankind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I know,&quot; said Susan; &quot;my husband
was old-fashioned, too. I&quot;&mdash;she stopped
short, because just then the door opened,
and Jane came in.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;220]</span></p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="h2a">REAL CONVERSATION</p>

<p class="indent">BOTH Susan and lover jumped rather
guiltily, but Jane didn't notice. Or
if she did notice, it did not impress her as
anything worthy consideration. Among
the little weeds in the rose-garden of life,
did you ever think of what a common one is
that bother over how people act when you
&quot;come in suddenly&quot;? It is one of the petty
tortures of everyday existence. &quot;They
stopped talking the instant they saw me!&quot;
&quot;They both turned red, when I opened the
door!&quot; Well, what if they did? Is it a
happening of the slightest moment? Unless
one is guilty and in dread of discovery,
what can it matter who chatters or of what?
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;221]</span>
Stop and realize the real, separate, distinct
meaning of the phrase &quot;He was above suspicion,&quot;
and see how it applies equally to
being safe from the evil thoughts <i>of</i> others
as well as being safe from the holding of evil
thoughts <i>towards</i> others. If people change
color at your approach and it makes you uncomfortable,
you are not above suspicion
either of or from others. Then look to it
well that henceforth you manage to root
out the double evil. There are a whole lot
of very uncomfortable family happenings
founded on the absolutely natural crossings
of family intercourse, and the only possible
way to go smoothly through such rapids is&mdash;as
the Irishman said&mdash;to pick up your
canoe and port around them. Don't go
down to the level of anything beneath your
own standard, because when you go down
anywhere for any reason, your standard
goes down with you. There is that peculiarity
about standards that we keep them
right with us, whether we go up or whether
we go down.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;222]</span>
&quot;Oh, Jane,&quot; said Susan, &quot;we're having
such an interesting time talking about your
religion.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane smiled. &quot;I'm glad,&quot; she said
simply. &quot;Did you decide to absorb some
of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I'm converted, anyhow,&quot; said the
aunt; &quot;nobody could live in the house
with you and not be, and Mr. Rath is going
to try it for a while, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane looked at Lorenzo a little roguishly.
&quot;It's a contagion in the town,&quot; she said;
&quot;I feel like an ancient missionary.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know,&quot; said Susan, &quot;holding up a
cross. I've seen them in pictures.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and I hold up the cross, too,&quot; said
Jane, &quot;only most people wouldn't know it.
Do you know what the cross meant in the
long-ago times,&mdash;before the Christian
era?&quot; she asked Lorenzo quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's the sunbeam transfixing and vivifying
the earth-surface. It was the holiest
symbol of the power of God. It embodied
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;223]</span>
divine life descending straight from heaven
and making itself a part of earth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My!&quot; exclaimed Susan, really amazed.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane smiled and laid her hand upon her
aunt's affectionately. &quot;I love my cross,&quot;
she said; &quot;it's the greatest emblem that
humanity can know, and, just because we
are human, it will always keep coming back
into our lives. Only it shouldn't be
preached as a burden, it should be preached
as an opportunity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo sat watching her. A curious
white look passed over his face. He felt
for the moment that he hardly ought to
dare hope that this girl who was so full of
help for all should narrow her field of labor
to just him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You'll end by being like Dinah in <i>Adam
Bede</i>,&quot; he said, trying to laugh; &quot;you like
to teach and preach, don't you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't know,&quot; said Jane; &quot;it's always
there, right on my heart and lips. I feel
as if the personal 'I' was only its voice.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't think she's exactly human,&quot;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;224]</span>
said Susan meditatively; &quot;she doesn't
strike me so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't say that, Auntie,&quot; said the young
girl quickly; &quot;I want to be human more
than anything else. I don't want to make
you or anybody feel that I'm not. It would
be as dreadfully lonely to be looked upon as
unhuman as to be looked upon as inhuman.
I want to work and love and be loved.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you're so different from everybody
else,&quot; said her aunt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I don't want to be different. I
want to just be a woman&mdash;or a girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Some kindly intuition prompted Susan to
change the subject. &quot;Mr. Rath and I
were talking about girls just now; we both
thought what a pity it is that there are so
few in these days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I guess there are just as many girls as
ever, only they aren't so conspicuous,&quot;
Jane said, laughing at Lorenzo.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think they're more conspicuous,&quot;
said Lorenzo, &quot;only they're the wrong
kind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;225]</span>
&quot;I liked the old kind,&quot; said Susan, &quot;the
kind that stayed at home and wasn't wild
to get away and be going into business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane laughed again. &quot;You ought not
to blame the girls, Auntie. Lots of them
feel dreadfully over leaving home. But
they have to go out and work. I had to, I
know. It's some kind of big world-change
that's pushing us all on into different
places.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wasn't thinking of girls who do something
nice and quiet like you. I was thinking
of the others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They have to go, too,&quot; said Jane.
&quot;There's a fearful pressure that we don't
understand behind it all. A restlessness
and discontent that no one can alter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, that's true,&quot; said Lorenzo; &quot;I
never thought of it, but I can see that it is
so now that you've put it into my head.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've seen a lot of it. It's curious that
it seems to come equally to women who want
to work and to women who don't. I'm
sure I never wanted to earn my living, but
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;226]</span>
I was forced to it. And ever so many
others are, too. It's rather an awful feeling
that you're in the grip of a power that
sweeps your life beyond your guidance.
I'm trying hard to be big enough to live in
this century, but I'd have liked the last
better.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don't you consider that there's anything
voluntary in the way women are acting
now?&quot; Lorenzo asked, with real interest.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I'm afraid not. I think that
there's something we don't understand, or
grasp, or&mdash;or quite see rightly. I believe
that everything is ordered and ordered
ultimately for the best, and I see the problems
of to-day as surely here by God's
will and to be worked out by learning the
conduct of the current instead of opposing
it. But still I really don't understand it all
as I wish that I did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You really do feel God as a friend,&quot;
said Lorenzo, watching her illuminated face.
&quot;He isn't just a religion to you, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He's <i>everything</i> to me,&quot; said Jane reverently,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;227]</span>
&quot;Help and Sunlight and Strength
and Daily Bread. That part of Him that
is energy manifests in us in one way, and
that part of Him that is divine right and
justice manifests in us in another way. My
part in this life is to learn to use them together,
but they and all else are all God.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan rose from her seat and stood contemplating
her niece and Lorenzo by turns.
&quot;To think of talking like this in my house,&quot;
she said; &quot;this is what I call real conversation.
I tell you, Jane, you certainly did
lift me into another life when you invited
old Mrs. Croft here. Every kind of religion
sinks right into me now, and I can
believe without the least bother. It's wonderful,
but I'm going to have a short-cake
for tea, so I'll have to go.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She went away, and Lorenzo turned to
the window.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a little pause while he wondered
about many things. Finally he held
out his hand abruptly. &quot;You've gone a
long way, Jane,&quot; he said, &quot;you've got a big
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;228]</span>
grip on life and its meaning, and you make
me understand as I never did before how
hopeless it is to wish that the wheels of time
will turn backward. But whatever you
may preach, you only prove what I said
and what I feel, that the old-fashioned,
sweet, home-keeping, winning and winnable
girl is gone, only she's gone in a different
way from what most people understand.
When she still exists, she exists for herself&mdash;not
for a man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane felt her eyes fill suddenly. &quot;Why
do you say that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because you prove it. A man might
adore you, but he couldn't hope to get you.
Could he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes dropped. &quot;Do you think that
it's all any harder on the man than it is on
the girl?&quot; she asked. &quot;If men feel bad
nowadays over the changes, how do you
suppose it is with the woman, unfitted to
fight and forced into the battle. A woman
isn't built as a man is; she's created for
another kind of work, much harder and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;229]</span>
lasting, much longer than any man's labor.
And she has to leave that work of her own
either undone or only half-done and do
things unsuited to her. Of course there
are some girls and women who like it,&mdash;but
most of them don't. Most of them feel
dreadfully and would give anything to be
able to stay in a home and live the life God
meant to be woman's. There's always a
pitiful story behind nine out of every ten
bread-winning women, whether they go
out washing or are artists like you. A
woman never leaves her home until she's
forced to do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sure that you know what you're
talking about? Aren't you an idealist?
Look at Emily Mead&mdash;&quot; he smiled in spite
of his earnestness. &quot;If she had a rag of
a chance, she'd fly off to-morrow. It
wouldn't take force.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane remained carefully grave. &quot;That's
more her mother's fault than hers. Her
mother has taught her that girls only live
to marry.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;230]</span>
&quot;And quite right, too. Don't you believe
it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It used to be true, but it isn't now. A
girl can't marry without a man, and the
world's all disjointed. It's a part of that
strange new leaven which causes civilization
to drive men and women both to become
homeless by separating them widely on
earth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course it's a governmental crime to
send men by the hundreds of thousands to
fight it out alone in Canada and leave
their sisters to be old maids in England,
but governments are pretty stupid, nowadays.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are all pretty stupid. We build
all our difficulties and then hang to them
and their consequences for dear life. It's
too bad in us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean woman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I mean everybody.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's depressing, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't think so. I think it's grand.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grand!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;231]</span>
&quot;Yes, because I like to struggle in a big
way. And then, too, if I'm a woman forced
to work because I'm one part of the problem,
I'm also gloriously happy in being part
of the new upburst of comprehension that's
balancing and will soon overbalance such a
lot of the troubles.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You mean? Oh, you mean your way of
looking at things.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I do. I'm so blessedly glad
of every circumstance in my life, because
each one led to my getting hold of just what
I have got hold of. I'm perfectly happy
and perfectly content. It's so beautiful
to be guided by a rule that never fails.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo couldn't but laugh. &quot;I tell
you what,&quot; he said gayly, &quot;I'll let you into
a little secret. I've made up my mind to
go to work and learn how to work that game
of yours myself. I want to be blessedly
glad and gloriously happy, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You've got to be in earnest, you know,&quot;
Jane said. &quot;It's handling live wires to
amuse oneself with any force of God, and
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;232]</span>
will-power is more of a force than electricity.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I'm in earnest,&quot; said the artist.
&quot;I've made my picture&mdash;as you say&mdash;and
I hang to it for grim death. Only I
can't see, if you feel as you do about home
and marriage, and all that, why you don't
make one, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm making ever so many homes,&quot; said
Jane. &quot;I'm teaching home-making.
That's a Sunshine Nurse's business, and it
would be selfish in me to desert my task.
Besides&mdash;&quot; she paused.</p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="h2a">THE MOST WONDERFUL THING EVER
HAPPENED</p>

<p class="indent">SHE stopped and hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said impatiently, &quot;besides&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wonder if it would be right to be quite
frank with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing sincere is ever wrong. Of
course you ought to be quite frank with me,&mdash;aren't
you that with every one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still she considered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What stops you?&quot; he asked. &quot;Go on.
Tell me everything. It's my right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why is it your right?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because I love you, and you know it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She started violently, then turned very
white. &quot;Don't say that. I've always
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;234]</span>
thought of you as engaged to Madeleine.
She was talking to me, and I thought&mdash;I&mdash;&quot;
She stopped, quite shaken.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You misunderstand her. She's always
been in love with one fellow&mdash;the one that
her parents are against. He's even poorer
than I am.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Jane pressed her lips together and
interlocked her fingers. &quot;I can never
marry. I never think of it. There's money
to be paid, nobody to pay it but me, and no
way to get it except to earn it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo looked almost sternly at her.
&quot;What about the book you lent me; it
would say that that was setting limits. It
says that we've not to concern ourselves
with ways and means. I've only to concern
myself with loving you. The rest will
come along of its own accord.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head. &quot;No, it won't.
This world is all learning, and it's part of
my lesson not to be able to apply it in absolute
faith to myself. So many teachers
have wisdom to give away which they can't
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;235]</span>
quite take unto themselves, you know.&quot;
She smiled a little tremulously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you ought to take it unto yourself.
It ought to be easy and simple for you to
realize that if conditions are false, they don't
exist; that if you want a home, it's because
you are going to have one; that if I love
you, it's because it's right that you should be
loved.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She put her hands down helplessly on
each side of the chair-seat. &quot;I never even
think of such things,&quot; she said, almost in a
whisper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But why not?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've always been so necessary to others.
I've no rights in my own life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But if life is a thing to guide, why not
guide your beneficence as well from a basis
of home as from one of homelessness?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing has ever seemed to be for me,
myself. Everything has always pointed to
me for others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo paced back and forth. &quot;But it
is the women like you who should show the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;236]</span>
way out of the wilderness and back to the
right, instead of attempting to order the
chaos while sweeping on with it. If there
be a real truth in this new teaching which
lays hold of all those who are in earnest so
easily and so quickly, its first care should
be to demonstrate happiness in the lives of
its believers,&mdash;not the negative happiness
of wide-spread devotion to others, but the
positive lessons of joy in the center from
which springs&mdash;must spring&mdash;the next
generation of better, wiser men and women,
those among whom I expect to live as an old
man.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane turned her face away, her eyes filled
with tears. &quot;You make me feel very small
and petty,&quot; she said; &quot;you show me a way
beyond what I had guessed. But I can't
grasp at it; I'm too used to asking nothing
for myself. I'm always so sure that God
is managing for me. And I have so much
to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps realization that God is managing
is all that you need to set right. Perhaps
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;237]</span>
that confidence will bring you all
things. Even me.&quot; He laughed a little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has brought me all that I needed.
Daily bread, daily possibilities of helpfulness,&mdash;I
don't ask more, except 'more
light.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It sounds a little presumptuous coming
from me, but perhaps I can help you towards
your end, even as to 'more light.' At any
rate, I'll try if you'll let me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She sat quite still. Finally she lifted up
her eyes&mdash;and they were beautiful eyes,
big and true&mdash;and said, the words coming
softly forth: &quot;It would be so wonderful.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo didn't speak. He felt choked
and gasping. To him it was also &quot;so wonderful,&quot;
as wonderful as if he hadn't lived
with it night and day ever since the first
minute of knowing her. &quot;I think I'd better
go,&quot; he said very gently, realizing keenly
that he must not press her in this first blush
of the new spring-time. &quot;I've 'made my
picture' you know, and I won't let it fade,
you may be sure. And you must believe
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;238]</span>
in happiness for yourself,&mdash;you tell us that
the first step is all that counts. Get the
seed into the ground then. I'll do the rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She sat quite still. &quot;If I could only
try,&quot; she whispered. He turned quickly
away and was gone.</p>

<p class="indent">After a dizzy little while she rose and
went into the kitchen. Susan was moving
briskly about.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Two cups flour, four teaspoonfuls baking
powder, one of sugar, one of salt, two
of butter, two of lard, cup half water, half
milk, pour in pan greased and bake in hot
oven. Scotch scone-bread for lunch,&quot; she
said, almost suiting the deed to the word.
&quot;Is Mr. Rath still here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, he's gone.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know, Jane, he's caught your religion.
I never heard anything like it.
He's got the whole thing pat. I'd be almost
scared to go round teaching a thing like
that. Why, folks'll be doing anything they
please soon. I've been wondering if I could
get strong enough to kind of dispose of
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;239]</span>
Matilda, in some perfectly right way, you
know. I wouldn't think of anything that
wasn't perfectly right, you know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane seemed a little numb and stood
watching the buttering of the scone-pan
without speaking.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I keep saying: 'Matilda doesn't want
to come back. Matilda's disposed of in a
perfectly pleasant way.' I've been saying
it ever since I began on those scones. I
guess I've said it twenty times, and I'm
beginning to make a real impression on myself.
I'm beginning to feel sure God is
fixing things up. It's too beautiful to feel
God taking an interest in your affairs.
Matilda doesn't want to come home.
Matilda is completely disposed of in a perfectly
pleasant way.&quot; Susan's accents were
very emphatic.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Auntie,&quot; said Jane, turning her eyes
towards her and rallying her attention by a
strong effort, &quot;you know your perfect faith
is because Aunt Matilda really isn't anxious
to come home. It's only if you're doubting
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;240]</span>
that there's any doubt about it. One
doesn't alter Destiny, one only apprehends
it. Oh, dear,&quot; she said though, sitting
down suddenly, and hiding her face in her
hands, &quot;the thing about light is that it
always keeps bursting over you with a new
light, and my own teaching has suddenly
come to me as if I'd never known what any
of it meant before. I'm too stunned at
seeing how I've limited myself. I'm really
too stupid.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan glanced at her as she poured the
batter into the pan, and then kept glancing.
Her face grew softened, &quot;I wouldn't worry,
dear,&quot; she said finally, &quot;don't you bother
over anything. God's taking care of everything
and everybody. It's every bit of it
all right. You must know that yourself,
or you never could have taught it to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I do know it,&mdash;but in spite of
myself I can't see&mdash;I can't dare think&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You told me not to worry over old Mrs.
Croft,&quot; said Susan, coming around by her
side and putting her arm about her; &quot;you
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;241]</span>
said worry spoiled everything. And I did
try so hard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, I know, I'll try. I really will&mdash;But&mdash;&quot;
suddenly she turned deep crimson,
&quot;it seems too awful for me to take one
minute to work on myself or my life. I
need all my time for others.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you don't have to,&quot; said Susan,
&quot;all you've got to do is to know things are
right. You know they're right because
they are right. Everything's coming along
fine, and you just feel it coming; that's
your part. My goodness, Jane, isn't this
funny? There isn't a blessed thing you've
preached to me that I ain't having to preach
back to you now. You don't seem to have
sensed hardly any of your own meaning.
Talk about being a channel; you'd better
choke up a little and hold back some for
yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane threw her arms around her and
kissed her. &quot;Auntie, you're right, you're
right. I won't doubt a mite more. I'll try
to know as much as I seem to have taught.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;242]</span>
&quot;Just be yourself, you Sunshine Jane,
you,&quot; Susan was clinging close to the girl
she loved so well, &quot;just be yourself. Nothing
else is needed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; Jane whispered, &quot;I will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's the thing,&quot; said Susan; &quot;'cause
you've certainly taught us a lot. I'll lay
the table now,&quot; she moved towards the door,
&quot;Matilda doesn't want to come home. Matilda
wants to stay away in some perfectly
pleasant way,&quot; she added with heavy emphasis,
passed through, and let the door close.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane was left alone in the kitchen.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He said he loved me!&quot; she thought
over and over. &quot;It seems so wonderful&mdash;the
most wonderful thing that has ever
happened since the world was made. He
said he loved me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She went up-stairs to her own room and
shut the door softly. &quot;Of course I can never
marry him,&quot; she whispered aloud, &quot;but
he did say he loved me. Oh, I know that
nothing so wonderful ever was in this world
before!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="h2a">WHY JANE SHOULD HAVE BELIEVED</p>

<p class="indent">THE Sunshine Nurse was long in seeking
sleep that night and early to rise
the next morning. She found herself suddenly
metamorphosed&mdash;facing a new
world&mdash;two worlds in fact. There was the
world of Lorenzo's actually loving her,
which was a dream from which she would
surely awaken, and then there was that
second world of wonder, the world of her
own teaching, a world in which she started,
big-eyed, at all in which she had trusted,
and wondered if it could be possible that
what she believed firmly and preached so
ardently was really true. &quot;It isn't setting
limits to face what must be,&quot; she said
over and over to herself, &quot;and I <i>must</i> pay
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;244]</span>
poor father's debts, and there is no possible
way for me to get the money except to
earn it bit by bit.&quot; The statement had
gone to bed with her, and it rose with her
when she rose; it looked indisputable, incontrovertible,
as all fixed statements have
a way of looking&mdash;and yet each time that
she made it she felt hot with guilt. &quot;It's
setting limits,&quot; cried her soul, &quot;it's saying
that God can't possibly do what He pleases,&quot;
and, as she listened to the strong, heaven-sent
cry of rebellion against petty earthly
laws, she struggled in the meshes of her own
old earlier learning, the &quot;old garment&quot;
which clings so close about us all, and which
we simply must discard before we can don
the new robe of Infinite Hope and Radiant
Belief in God's law of Only Good for Each
and Every One.</p>

<p class="indent">Jane always rose an hour before her aunt.
The hour was spent in opening windows,
brushing up and building the kitchen fire.
It was always a pleasant hour, for she
usually filled it to the brim with work well
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;245]</span>
done and thoughts sent strongly and happily
out over the coming time. But to-day
all this was changed; new thoughts rioted
forth on every side, and a sort of chaos took
the place of her usually sunny calm. This
riot and chaos is the common, logical outcome
of all who feel sure that they are wiser
than God. You cannot possibly set any
border to His Kingdom and then be happy
in that outer darkness which you have
deliberately chosen for your own part. As
well ask a cow to shut herself out of her
pasture and rest happy in the waste beyond.
&quot;I mustn't think, because it is none of it
for me&mdash;&quot; she repeated over and over,
much as if the aforesaid cow declared, &quot;I
am barred out&mdash;I can never get back&mdash;I
must starve contentedly.&quot; Jane&mdash;who
would have laughed at my illustration
quite as you have laughed yourself&mdash;saw
only distress in her own, and had to wink
away so many tears that finally in maddest
self-defense she rushed out doors and fled
to the little garden that had, through so
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;246]</span>
many years, been Susan's refuge in such a
droll way.</p>

<p class="indent">And Lorenzo was there!</p>

<p class="indent">He looked very blithe and happy.
&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;have you thought it over
and decided that you're right, after all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was panting, and surprise flooded
her face with color. &quot;Oh&mdash;&quot; she gasped,
&quot;oh!&quot; and then: &quot;Right&mdash;of course
I'm right!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He approached, his hand extended.
&quot;Right in believing, or right in mistrusting?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She gave him her hand, and he took it.
&quot;Don't put it that way,&quot; she said; &quot;it
isn't that way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, dear Jane, that's the only way to
put it. It's the way you've been teaching
us. Either we can look up and ahead confidently,
or you're all wrong. I can't believe
that you're ever even a little bit
wrong, so I'm going to believe that it's all
true.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no&mdash;it isn't&mdash;I mean&mdash;Oh, in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;247]</span>
my case, it can't be so. Everything that
I said was true, only I myself am meant to&mdash;to
work&mdash;not to&mdash;to marry. It's a kind
of pledge I've taken to myself. It doesn't
change the teaching.&quot; Then she dragged
her hand free.</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo smiled. &quot;You can't tell me any
of that. I know. I'm the happiest man
in the world.&quot; Then he went on, taking
up the rake and scratching a little here
and there: &quot;Like other pupils, I've surpassed
my teacher. You've preached, and
I practice; you can describe God's thoughts,
and I think them. You're sure that He
can do anything, and I know what He's
going to do. I've been let straight into one
of His secrets. It's been revealed to me
how the world is run.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane stared. &quot;How can you talk so?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I talk so because I know so. Everything's
coming right for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You're crazy,&quot; she tried to laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I've heard people say that of you. Not
that it matters.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;248]</span>
She stood watching him and considering
his words. &quot;I wouldn't let you give me the
money to straighten out my father's affairs,
even if you were ever so rich, you know,&quot;
she said slowly. &quot;I couldn't.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I wouldn't let Auntie pay the debts.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know. God doesn't require either
your aunt's help or mine in this matter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane's eyes moistened slightly. &quot;Please
don't make a joke of anything so hard and
sad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm not joking; I'm a veritable apostle
of joy. I'm as happy as I can be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked at him with real wonder because
his appearance certainly bore out
his words. &quot;I wish that I knew what you
meant.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He dropped the rake, came to her side,
and caught her hand. &quot;Can't you trust
God&mdash;can't you trust me?&mdash;won't you
try?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up into his face. &quot;I wish
that I could, but how can I?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;249]</span>
&quot;You ought to know. So deep and big
and true a nature. Surely you ought to
be able to understand your own teaching!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I can't see any way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your book says that one must not
think of ways; one must just look straight
to the good end.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, but there isn't any such end possible
for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo dropped her hand and laughed
out loud. And then he caught her in his
arms and kissed her.</p>

<p class="indent">She screamed. To her it was the greatest
shock of her life, for no man had ever kissed
her before. &quot;Oh&mdash;oh, mercy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Matters were not helped much by Susan's
looking over the fence just then and crying
out abruptly: &quot;Well, I declare!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mrs. Ralston,&quot; said Lorenzo, not even
blushing, &quot;you're the very person we need
this minute. I want to marry Jane, and
she won't hear to it because of her father's
debts. The debts are all right and everything's
all right, only she won't believe it.
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;250]</span>
I wish you'd climb the fence and help me
persuade her, for although I <i>know</i> she'll end
by marrying me, I've just set my heart on
converting her to her own religion first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan swung easily over the fence.
&quot;You're just right, Mr. Rath, you ought
to marry her. She's the nicest person to
have around the house that I ever saw; she's
far too good to be a nurse. How much
did your father owe, you Sunshine Jane,
you? Maybe I can pay it. I will if I
can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There,&quot; said Lorenzo; &quot;see how easy it
is to evolve money if you'd only trust a
little?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane looked at him and then at Susan.
&quot;I couldn't take your money, Auntie,&quot;
said she, quite gently, but quite firmly.
&quot;And then, too,&quot; she added, with her
roguish smile, &quot;you've left it to Aunt
Matilda.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but dear,&quot; Susan's face became
suddenly radiant, &quot;you know I've been
working your religion on her; maybe she
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;251]</span>
isn't coming back at all; maybe something
will happen; maybe she's going to be
drowned or something like that in some
perfectly right way.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Lorenzo soberly. &quot;It isn't
necessary to plan as to God's business at
all. He knows. I don't think that Jane
ought to take anybody's money; she ought
to pay the debts with her own money, but
I can't see why she can't trust and know it's
coming.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because there's no place for it to come
from,&quot; said Jane firmly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Unless Matilda&mdash;&quot; Susan interposed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe I'm better at her religion than
she is herself,&quot; said Lorenzo. &quot;I declare,
I believe that there's nothing that I can't
get now. I wanted a house, and I worked
just as the book said! I saw myself living
cosily alone, and in less than a week I was
living cosily alone. Now I want Jane with
me in the house, and I mean to have her,
and I shall have her, and there's no doubt
about that; but I do wish&mdash;with all my
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;252]</span>
heart&mdash;that she could rise to a higher
plane.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If that's all, I know how to manage that
easily enough,&quot; said Susan. &quot;We could
get old Mr. Cattermole in for a week and
raise Jane's plane with him, just like she
raised mine with Mrs. Croft.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, she'll rise,&quot; said her lover quietly.
&quot;We must give her time and help her,
that's all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane stood doubting between them. Her
aunt regarded her wistfully. &quot;Dear me,&quot;
she said, &quot;I wonder if I could screw myself
up to believing she'll come in for a fortune.
I want to help, but I'm a little like her&mdash;I
can't for the life of me see where it's to
come from.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But that isn't the question at all,&quot; said
Lorenzo, &quot;the question isn't how&mdash;the
question is just the faith. Why, it's the
corner-stone of the whole thing! It's the
moving into God's world where nothing
but good can be, and you know you're
there because you see only good coming in
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;253]</span>
all directions! Just good&mdash;nothing but
good! I don't see why Jane holds back so.
I know that she can get that money and
get every other thing she wants in life, including
me, and I'm one of the nicest fellows
alive&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That's so&mdash;&quot; interposed Susan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If she'll only put out her hand with
confidence. I've studied that book till
I'm full of it, and I know that I'm going to
have her for my wife, and I know it absolutely,
and I want her to know it,
too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan began to get back over the fence.
&quot;I'm going in about breakfast,&quot; she said;
&quot;the trouble with us is we all need hot coffee
to brace up our souls.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep on declaring the truth,&quot; Lorenzo
reminded her, as she walked off upon the
other side.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will. I'll say 'Jane is going to get
some money' and 'Matilda doesn't want to
come home to live,' alternately.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When she was out of hearing the two
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;254]</span>
young people remained silent for a few
seconds. Then the man spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear,&quot; his voice was very gentle, &quot;I
want to tell you something. I've had a
very great experience in the last twenty-four
hours. It isn't loving you&mdash;it's that I've
been allowed to see a little bit of life from
God's standpoint. Don't you want to
know the real truth about all this?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm going to tell you, because you'll see
the lesson and learn it with me. We don't
doubt that God knows all that has been or
is to be, do we?&mdash;or that in our minutes of
fiercest pain or trouble He looks calmly to
the end beyond?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She shook her head. &quot;No, of course
not.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, dearest girl, I was allowed last
night to put myself in the Deity's place
and see one corner of the universe as He
must see the whole.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her eyes grew big. &quot;What do you
mean?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean this. I want you, and I understand
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;255]</span>
perfectly about the money. I sat
down last night and I labored with myself
until I made myself <i>know</i> that it was yours.
I can't tell you just how it came to me, but
I knew it. It is yours and yours absolutely,
and now I want you to realize it and believe
in it without question, before I give it to
you. Will you do that? I'm asking of
you the faith that Jesus preached. Can
you believe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane looked at him wonderingly. &quot;You
mean&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I mean just what I say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't receive money from you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It isn't my money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't understand. I only know that
there is no way that I can get the money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo looked at her a minute, and then
said slowly and very gently: &quot;I've found
Mrs. Croft's will. She left all that she had
to whoever took care of her the night she
died. It appears that she had a good deal
more than any one supposed. It's all
yours, dear. Now you see why you should
have trusted.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="h2a">IN A PERFECTLY RIGHT WAY</p>

<p class="indent">WHEN Susan, looking out of the
window, saw the two whom she
had left behind coming across the grass,
she knew instantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They've settled it somehow,&quot; she exclaimed
in supremest joy, and whirled to
whisk the bacon off the stove.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Auntie,&quot; said Jane, from outside the
window, the minute after, &quot;I am just
dumb. I don't believe I'll ever be able to
lift up my head in life again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Auntie,&quot; said Lorenzo, over her
shoulder, &quot;she's inherited her fortune.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan gave a scream. &quot;Oh, good
mercy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, dear,&quot; said her niece, now in the
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;257]</span>
doorway, &quot;only I can't believe it. I think
that it's a dream.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see she still isn't able to rise to
the proper heights of trust,&quot; laughed her
lover, also now in the doorway, &quot;but I
have hopes of yet teaching her to believe
what she believes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come straight in and help me set all
this on the table, so that I can listen with
a free mind.&quot; Susan's appeal was pathetic
in the extreme. &quot;Where <i>did</i> she get it,
anyhow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Auntie, it's the most wonderful
thing you ever heard of.&quot; Jane took up
the coffee-pot and led the way.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did it all, except I didn't provide the
money,&quot; said Lorenzo, and the next minute
they were all seated, and he could tell the
whole story.</p>

<p class="indent">Susan didn't scream. She sat still, a
bit of toast in her hand, listening breathlessly.
When Lorenzo had finished, &quot;Oh,
that new religion!&quot; she murmured in an
awed voice, and then, &quot;Nothing like this
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;258]</span>
ever happened in this town before, I
know.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm more bewildered over it's being
there for me and my not being able to believe
than I am by the money,&quot; said Jane.
&quot;Oh, Auntie, what a lesson, what a lesson!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You would limit yourself, you see,&quot;
said Lorenzo; &quot;you wouldn't believe.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How could I ever imagine such a
thing?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You didn't have to imagine,&mdash;you
only had to expect.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You laid limits, you see,&quot; said Susan,
suddenly beginning to pour out the coffee,
and pouring with a glad dash that swept
over cup and saucer together. &quot;I expect
if God hadn't been patient&mdash;like Mr.
Rath&mdash;He could have very well hid that
will forever. There may be a lot of such
goings on in the world, for all we know.
My goodness, suppose I'd been like Matilda
and not have had old Mrs. Croft around
for one minute,&mdash;it makes me ill to think
of it! It's a lesson for me, too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;259]</span>
&quot;Life is all lessons,&quot; said Jane. &quot;Dear
me, think of Aunt Matilda's surprise!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Think of it! Good mercy, how can I
wait to tell her!&quot; Susan's whole face
beamed. &quot;I don't mind a bit her coming
back now. That shows the good of making
that declaration about her. Those declarations
are a great thing. I've told
myself Matilda was coming back in a
perfectly right way so many times that now,
however she came back, I'd be positive it
was perfectly right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Auntie,&quot; said Jane, &quot;you've got
hold of another great truth. Every one
seems quicker than me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you started us at it, anyhow,&quot;
said Susan kindly. &quot;Oh my, but I'm
happy! Why, I believe I'm really in a
hurry now for Matilda to come back, just
so I can tell her. Think of that&mdash;me
really and truly anxious to see Matilda
again! My, you Sunshine Jane, you&mdash;what
a lot of difference you've made in
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;260]</span>
&quot;When is your aunt coming?&quot; Lorenzo
asked Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She went for three weeks,&quot; said Jane;
&quot;it will be three weeks next Thursday.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Goodness, only three weeks, and it
seems like three years?&quot; observed Susan.
&quot;What a lot has happened! There's Jane&mdash;and
her religion&mdash;and me up and well&mdash;and
old Mrs. Croft here and gone&mdash;and
you, Mr. Rath,&mdash;and then you and
Jane&mdash;and now this money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can't believe any of it,&quot; said Jane;
&quot;I try, but I just can't. I guess I'm hopelessly
limited. I'm too bewildered, I&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll tell you what ails you,&quot; said her
aunt warmly. &quot;It's that you've spread
yourself too much; you've given such a
lot away everywhere that you've got to
just stop and let the tide run backwards
into you yourself for a while. It's nature.
Nature and the new religion combined.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I feel overwhelmed by the coming-back
tide then,&quot; said Jane; &quot;I don't deserve
it all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;261]</span>
Her aunt started to reply, but was
stopped by a sudden loud bang outside.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Goodness, what's that?&quot; she exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Auto tire burst, I think. I'll go and
see,&quot; said Lorenzo, jumping up and going
out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jane,&quot; said Susan solemnly, &quot;that's a
young man in a million. Think of his
finding that will. My, but he'll make a
good husband!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I just can't realize any of it,&quot; said her
niece. She seemed to be totally unequal
to any other view of her present situation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, you'd better realize it,&quot; said her
aunt, &quot;because it's coming right along.
What will Mrs. Mead say, I wonder!
Dear me, how every one will wish they'd
tried to get up a plane or two by having old
Mrs. Croft to visit them. If that poor
old thing could only come back, the whole
town would just adore to have her on a
visit now, and every one would sit up all
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;262]</span>
night and listen to <i>Captain Jinks</i> so cheerfully.
She used to sing <i>Rally round the
flag, boys</i> too,&mdash;I forgot that. She used
to sing it when she heard the roosters begin
to crow. But nobody would have minded,
whatever she sang now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, there's&mdash;&quot; Jane hesitated and
blushed.</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo stood in the door. &quot;It wasn't a
burst tire,&quot; he explained briefly; &quot;it's a
new kind of siren they're using. It's
friends from out of town, Mr. and Mrs.
Beamer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They've got the wrong house,&quot; said
Susan. &quot;I don't know any Beamers.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They asked for Mrs. Ralston.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then they're selling something, grape-wine
or hand-knit lace, or something.
I don't want to see 'em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll go,&quot; said Jane. And went at once.
In the pretty, changed sitting-room she
found the visitors&mdash;Mrs. Beamer tall and
of large build, with a handsome motor-costume.
Mr. Beamer also large, very wiry,
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;263]</span>
and with rampant gray hair. Mrs. Beamer
was Matilda.</p>

<p class="indent">But what a changed Matilda! &quot;Well,
Jane,&quot; coming forward and holding out
both hands, &quot;did you and Susan feel it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane staggered and laid hold of a chair.
&quot;Feel&mdash;&quot; she stammered&mdash;&quot;feel what?
Oh, Aunt Matilda!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you feel the good I've been doing
you? How's my sister?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&mdash;oh, she's all right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Up and dressed?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, you see!&quot; Matilda turned to
Mr. Beamer, triumph radiating her whole
figure. &quot;It worked,&mdash;oh, Matthew, it
worked.&quot; Then she turned back to Jane.
&quot;Get up right off, didn't she? Same day
I left?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Y&mdash;yes.&quot; Jane clung more tightly to
the chair. She began to doubt the ground
beneath her feet.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perfectly well, strong, able-bodied,&mdash;isn't
she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;264]</span>
&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see?&mdash;&quot; to Mr. Beamer. Then,
&quot;Oh, it's too splendid! I s'pose the cat's
stopped snooping, too, hasn't he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Y&mdash;yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;House all clean? Garden growing
fine?&quot;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, indeed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you, Jane, how are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I'm all right. I&mdash;I've become
engaged.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You hear that, Matthew? And the
town?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Everybody's well.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did you ever in all your life!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, old Mrs. Croft died!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did she indeed. Katie happy?&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katie was away. She died here.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How nice! I expect she enjoyed every
minute of it. Oh, Jane, you don't know
how happy your every word is making
me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shan't I call auntie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, we'll go out and have breakfast
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;265]</span>
with you. We had one breakfast so as
to make it easy for you to have us have it
with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do come right out to the table.&quot; Jane
led the way. &quot;I can't think what Aunt
Susan will say!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind what she says&mdash;it'll be
just right. Everything always is. Come,
Matthew;&quot; then Mrs. Matilda Beamer led
off, and Mr. Matthew Beamer followed,
smiling cheerfully. He seemed to be a
very cheerful man.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perhaps I'd better go first and just
prepare auntie,&quot; Jane suggested hastily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No need. She always yelled when
she saw me suddenly, and this time it will
be for joy. Life is going to be all joy for
Susan now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Jane turned the button of the dining-room
door. &quot;Auntie Susan, it's Aunt
Matilda and Mr. Beamer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Susan justified her sister's views by forthwith
giving the yell of her whole life.
&quot;Ma&mdash;tilda!&mdash;And Mr. Beamer!&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;266]</span>
Matilda went up to her, seized her, gave
her a good hug and a real kiss. &quot;I've
made lots of mistakes,&quot; she said, with a
big tear in each eye, &quot;but somehow it was
written that I should be allowed to make
them right. Susan, this is Matthew. Sit
down, Matthew. Sit down, every one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lorenzo hastily pushed up chairs, and
they all sat down.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'll get some more dishes,&quot; Jane exclaimed,
hurrying into the pantry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Matilda!&quot; Susan looked almost ready
to faint. &quot;Are you&mdash;are you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I'm married,&quot; said Matilda. &quot;I don't
know what I've ever done to deserve it,
but I'm married. It's the most beautiful
romance that ever was in the world, and
we've come to tell you all about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, do!&quot; Susan exclaimed. &quot;Jane,
come back! Think of another romance,
and Matilda, too! Well, what next!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Matilda smiled quite radiantly. &quot;We
met on the train the day I left here,&quot; she
began; &quot;it was right off. He took me out
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;267]</span>
on the back platform of the car and opened
my eyes to life, and we just suited, didn't
we, Matthew?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell it all,&quot; said Mr. Beamer; &quot;tell
the beginning.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; said his wife, &quot;I will, I'll tell it
all. It's so splendid it would be a pity to
skip anything. You see, he looked at me
and&mdash;well, really, Matthew, I think you'd
better tell the first part.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, you tell,&quot; said Mr. Beamer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Matthew, you tell it, and I'll help
anywhere I can.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well,&quot; said her husband, &quot;then I'll
begin with saying, Sister Susan, Niece
Jane, and young man, that I'd better tell
you what I am, first of all, because I'm the
only one of the kind in the world so far
as I know. You see, one of those Bible
miracles, that no one can seem to lay hold
of any more, got into me, and I'm the
result.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That is all true,&quot; interposed Matilda,
her plain face quite metamorphosed, as
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;268]</span>
she looked at her husband and then at
them. &quot;Every word he says is true, and
it's all miracles.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see I was just a plain, ordinary
man, with a nice business and a good
disposition,&quot; Mr. Beamer went on, &quot;and
I did get so awful tired of things as they
were going, and I used to wish everything
was different, and then one day, all of a
God-blessed sudden, it came over me, with
a shock like lightning, that wanting things
different is the first step to getting 'em
different, and that if you've got the brain
to see what's lacking, you've got the body
to turn to and help fill up the hole. I
didn't get religion out of a book; I got it
just like that. I was sitting in a rocking-chair
with a palm-leaf fan, and I got up and
put the fan on the shelf and knew I was
all made new. The very next day I read
about a doctor as set up some nurses&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my goodness,&quot; Susan cried, &quot;hear
that, Jane!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&mdash;as was to spread sunshine, and I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;269]</span>
thought that was a good idea, only I
couldn't see a place in it for me, 'cause I
wasn't young and wasn't no girl to go
'round spreading nothing. I looked upon
it that being a man, my business wasn't
to spread things&mdash;a man's business is
to get the stuff to spread; so I figured out
that being as I was a man, I could maybe
help make the sunshine, and then any one
could slather it on that pleased. So I
began to look about for some sunshine to
make, and the handiest field I see was
folks with hard lines around their mouths;
there's a powerful lot of them around, you
know,&mdash;ain't nothin' so hard to break up
in life as hard lines around mouths. So I
set out to plow fields of hard lines.&quot;
He paused. It was a picture, a picture
painted in heavenly colors to see his face
at the moment, full of its own heartfelt,
tried, and true enthusiasm, and the faces
of those of his four listeners, each touched
with the spiritual light shed by recent
events over his or her own individual path.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;270]</span>
&quot;Do go on,&quot; Jane whispered softly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, whenever I'd see a hard man
sitting alone, I'd go up to him and hold
out my hand and say, 'Well, I ain't laid
eyes on you, I don't know when!' That
wasn't no lie, and 'most always we'd get
a-talking. Then I'd say, 'I'm a harmless
crank that likes to go round making friends,
and I took a fancy to you right off.' It
was wonderful all I come up against. Why,
the hardest folks was just aching to sit
down and explain that they wasn't hard at
all. It was the most interesting thing I
ever got hold of. I got arrested once for a
gold-brick man, and it give me a fine chance
at the jailers and some of the men in prison.
Pretty soon everything that turned up
seemed to just come along to give me a
chance to make a little sunshine. Pretty
soon life was all nothing but sunshine
chances. I got hold of some books that
showed me that lots of others were trying
some similar games, and all working hard,
and I picked out one book that 'most anybody
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;271]</span>
could understand, and I used to carry
it to read from. Would you believe that
I wore out that book about a hundred
times and sold it more'n five hundred times
and give it away 'most a thousand times.
I got where hard lines was just play to me.
I've now got where they're flowers in my
garden. I just fly at 'em. If they don't
give up to one course, they do to another.
I travel about looking for 'em. I was on
my last trip when I see Matilda sittin'
across the aisle from me, and I said to
myself right off, 'What fine lines!' So I
went right over and shook hands with
her&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He said he feared maybe he'd made
a mistake,&quot; interrupted his wife, &quot;and I
said&mdash;God forgive me!&mdash;'If you speak
to me again, I'll call out to the conductors!'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I said: 'Madam, excuse me, I'm
only a harmless crank as is trying to help
folks as is sick or in trouble, and you look
like a woman as could tell me of some I
could help, maybe!'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;272]</span>
&quot;Then I thought of you, Susan,&quot; said
the sister; &quot;you see, I'd been looking out
of the window, and the view was so pretty,
and it kind of come over me how awful
hard it was to lie in bed&mdash;and&mdash;and I felt
kind of bad, and his face looked kind, and
I said: 'Well, sit down. I do know somebody
sick.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I set down,&quot; went on Mr. Beamer,
&quot;and in just a little while she let up like
everybody does and told me the whole
story, and then I took her out on the
back platform and we was swinging 'round
curves of mighty lovely scenery, and I got
out my book and I begin to read aloud to
her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And I got hold of the idea like mad,&quot;
said Matilda. &quot;I said right off: 'Then
Susan's really all well now?' an' he said:
'She's been well always,' and I says:
'And my arm's well,' and he said: 'Nothin'
ain't ever ailed your arm except your own
innard feelings, and they're gone now,'
and then I just put my hands over my face
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;273]</span>
and says: 'Oh, God, forgive me for lots
and lots and lots of things.'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was another little pause, and then
Susan said very low: &quot;And God did it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then,&quot; said Mr. Beamer, &quot;I says
to her: 'Now, if you want to see how true
everything I've been saying is, we'll just
put this to a practical proof.' I'd noticed
a woman with lines back there in the car
slapping two sleepy children, and I told
Matilda we'd each take a child for an hour
and give her lines a chance to smooth out
a little, and then we'd come back on the
platform and talk it over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So we did it,&quot; said Matilda, &quot;and when
I took the baby back to the woman, she
burst out crying and said she'd tried to
hold in all day and just couldn't any longer,
cause her mother was sick and had been
sick so long, and she couldn't leave the
children to go to her 'cause the children was
the neighbor's and left with her to board,
and she'd never liked children and only took
'em 'cause her mother needed the money.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;274]</span>
&quot;Showing,&quot; interrupted Mr. Beamer,
&quot;how we'd misjudged her and her hard
lines, which is another feature of my crusade,
as lots don't think enough about.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what come next was just like a
story, too,&quot; Matilda said. &quot;When I got
to Mrs. Camp's at last, I found Mrs. Camp
so changed that if I hadn't met Matthew
on the train and got something to hold
on to, I couldn't have stayed in the house
an hour.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, what was the matter with Mrs.
Camp?&quot; Susan asked anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, all Mrs. Camp's family is married
now, and it seems she was so lonely she's
turned into a social settler or some such
thing, and her nice, quiet house where I'd
looked to rest was one swarm of Italians
learning English and girls learning sewing
and women asking advice and such a chaos
of Bedlam you never dreamed. If it
hadn't been for my just having got religion
that way, I'd have turned around and come
straight back home. But as it was, I
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;275]</span>
didn't have time to do anything but get
into my blue print and take hold right
with her and get some order into things
in general.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Aunt Matilda!&quot; Jane's face was
radiant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Afternoons Matthew came with an
auto, and he'd take me off with the back
seat full of children, and we'd hunt hard
lines anywhere they looked likely.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And then, of course, we soon got married,&quot;
said Mr. Beamer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, and that's all,&quot; said Matilda.
&quot;<i>Now did you ever?</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a sudden hush, until finally
Susan said, through tears: &quot;Oh, Matilda,&mdash;it's
like something in heaven's got loose
and fell right down over us, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think it's all too wonderful,&quot; said
Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course there really is something out
of heaven spread over earth every day,&quot;
said Lorenzo, low, and very reverently;
&quot;only people don't see it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;276]</span>
&quot;But nowadays, everybody's beginning
to recognize it,&quot; Jane murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It's like it says in one of my books,&quot;
said Mr. Beamer. &quot;God's a reservoir and
we're all pipes, just as soon as we're willing
to be pipes, and then He pours through us
according to how willing we are, because
you're big or little just according to how
willing you are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let us all be very willing,&quot; said Jane.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Jane,&quot; said Susan, &quot;that sounds
like a blessing to ask at the table. Let's
ask a blessing after this and just say:
'Let us all be very willing!'&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Amen,&quot; said Lorenzo.</p>

<hr class="hr2"/>

<p><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;277]</span></p>

<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="h2a">THE RESULTS</p>

<p class="indent">JANE was married in the early autumn.</p>

<p class="indent">She didn't have any trousseau or any
wedding presents or any bridal trip. It was
a new kind of wedding, because so much
about her and her way of looking at life
was new to those about her, that even her
marriage had to match it. &quot;My clothes
are always in nice order,&quot; she said to Susan,
slightly appalled over the non-existing preparations,
&quot;and I love to sew and will
make what I need as I need it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't want any presents,&quot; Lorenzo
had said decidedly. &quot;I don't want any
one on earth to groan because I'm marrying
Jane.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don't think much of bridal trips;
<span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;278]</span>
Matthew and I didn't have one, so I know
all about them,&quot; said Matilda, who now
had her standard and never lowered it for
one instant; &quot;those bothers are just about
over for sensible people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So it all fell out in this way. One lovely
bright September day, Mr. and Mrs.
Beamer and Mrs. Susan Ralston walked
quietly into the village church and sat
down in the front pew. Shortly after
the clergyman and the bride and the groom
came in, and the clergyman married the
bride to the groom. Then they all went
out together, and the clergyman left them
to go home together. A nice cold luncheon
was spread at Susan's, and the cat was
waiting, scratching hard at his white bow
while he did so.</p>

<p class="indent">After luncheon Mr. Beamer, his wife,
and his wife's sister went off for a journey.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Think of me traveling!&quot; Susan cried
ecstatically. &quot;Oh, Jane, may you enjoy
going abroad this winter as much as I shall
going off now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum">[Pg&nbsp;279]</span>
Jane smiled her pretty smile, and then,
after the last wave of adieu, she and Lorenzo
went back into the house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is really very funny, you know,&quot;
said Lorenzo; &quot;first we will wash all the
dishes, and then we will plan our future.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes,&quot; Jane said.</p>

<p class="indent">But they failed to do either.</p>

<p class="indent">Instead, they left the dishes and the future
to care for themselves. Going straight
down into the garden, climbing the two
fences, safely secluded in the little, growing,
blooming inclosure, Lorenzo took his wife
in his arms, and said: &quot;Oh, my dearest
dear, how rightest right everything is!&quot;</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
